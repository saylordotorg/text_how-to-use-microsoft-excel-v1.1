    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_p01">This section reviews the use of logical functions in Excel through the construction of an investment portfolio. Although it may seem that managing investments is a specialized career choice, the reality is that almost everyone will become an investor at some point in their lives. Many companies offer employees retirement savings benefits through <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">401(k) or 403(b)</a><span class="glossdef">Employee retirement savings plans offered by businesses and by public and private institutions. These plans allow you to deduct money from your paycheck every month, tax-free, and invest it.</span></span> plans. These plans allow you to deduct money from your paycheck every month, tax-free, and invest it. In addition to the tax benefits afforded by such plans, many employers match a percentage of your monthly savings or deposit money into your retirement account as an added form of compensation. When you sign up for these savings plans, your company will give you a list of options as to how your money can be invested, and you choose the type of investments you would like the company to make on your behalf. As a result of this process, you become an investor. Excel can be an extremely valuable tool to help you make these investment decisions and analyze the performance of the money you have invested.</p>

The headings in these columns show the investment that pertains to the data in Columns C through X.

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s02_p02">We will begin developing the personal investment portfolio workbook by adding several formulas and functions. The formulas and functions we will add were illustrated in detail in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02">Chapter 2 "Mathematical Computations"</a>. Therefore, the steps provided in this chapter will be brief. After the formulas and functions are added to the <strong class="emphasis bold">Investment Detail</strong> worksheet, we can add the logical and lookup functions. However, before proceeding, let’s review the investment type definitions in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s02_t01">Table 3.1 "Investment Types in Column A of the Investment Detail Worksheet"</a>. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s02_t01">Table 3.1 "Investment Types in Column A of the Investment Detail Worksheet"</a> provides a definition for each of the investment types listed in Column A of the <strong class="emphasis bold">Investment Detail</strong> worksheet. This project assumes that the personal investment portfolio comprises four types of investments. The reason we include a variety of investment types in any portfolio is to manage our total risk, or potential of losing money. When building an investment portfolio, it is important to keep in mind that investments of all types can dramatically increase or decrease in value over a short period of time. Managing risk requires that your money is not concentrated in one type of investment.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s02_p07">We will add a basic formula to the Current Purchase Value and Current Investment Value columns. For the Estimated Dividend Payments column, we will use the FV (future value) function to estimate the dividend payments. The following explains how we add the FV function to the Estimated Dividend Payments column:</p>

            <li>Click cell D4, type a forward slash (<strong class="emphasis bold">/</strong>) for division, and then type <strong class="emphasis bold">12</strong>. This divides the rate in the Dividend/Yield column by 12. The length of ownership of an investment is expressed in terms of months in Column Q. Therefore, the rate for the FV function must be expressed in terms of months by dividing the annual rate by 12.</li>
            <li>Type a comma.</li>
            <li>Click cell Q4, which contains the number of months owned or the term of the future value calculation.</li>
            <li>Type a comma followed by a zero (<strong class="emphasis bold">,0</strong>). We are not calculating an annuity or periodic investment in this example, so the <strong class="emphasis bold">PMT</strong> argument will be defined with a zero. Type a comma to advance the function to the <strong class="emphasis bold">Pv</strong> argument.</li>
            <li>Type a minus sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">−</strong>) and click cell G4. This is the cost of the investment purchase previously calculated.</li>

            <li>Type a minus sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">−</strong>) and click cell G4. By itself, the FV function is calculating the total value of the investment with dividends or interest earned. To show only the amount of dividends or interest earned, we subtract the cost of the investment purchase in G4 from the result of the FV function.</li>
            <li>Press the ENTER key on your keyboard.</li>
            <li>Adjust the decimal places for the output of the FV function to zero.</li>
            <li>Copy the FV function in cell J4 and paste it into the range J5:J18 using the Paste Formulas command.</li>

The formula used to calculate the Current Investment Value illustrates why we used the FV function to calculate the estimated dividend or interest payments for an investment. Investments that earn interest or dividends can achieve growth in two ways. The first way is through interest or dividend payments. The second way is through changes in the price paid for the investment. The formula used to calculate the Current Purchase Value is taking the number of shares purchased for each investment and multiplying it by the current market price. Therefore, the Current Investment Value takes into account any changes in the investment price by adding the purchase value at the current market price to any dividends or interest payments earned.</p>

A logical test is used in logical functions to evaluate the contents of a cell location. The results of the logical test can be either true or false. For example, the logical test <em class="emphasis">C7 = 25</em> (read as “if the value in cell C7 is equal to 25”) can be either true or false depending on the value that is entered into cell C7. A logical test can be constructed with a variety of comparison operators, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s03_t01">Table 3.6 "Comparison Operator Symbols and Definitions"</a>. These comparison operators will be used in the logical test arguments for the logical functions demonstrated in this chapter.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s05_p02">The OR function is similar to the IF function in that it uses a logical test to evaluate the contents of a cell location. However, the OR function allows you to define several logical tests as opposed to just one. If <em class="emphasis">one</em> of the logical tests is true, the output of the function will be the word <em class="emphasis">TRUE</em>. If <em class="emphasis">all</em> the logical tests are false, the output of the function will be the word <em class="emphasis">FALSE</em>. This differs from the IF function because the output of the function is only the word <em class="emphasis">TRUE</em> or the word <em class="emphasis">FALSE</em>. As a result, the OR function is commonly used within the IF function to enable specific outputs to be defined.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s07_p02">When constructing the IF function, the logical test can produce only two potential outcomes when evaluating the data in a cell. In addition, the function can produce only two possible outputs, which are defined in the <strong class="emphasis bold">value_if_true</strong> and <strong class="emphasis bold">value_if_false</strong> arguments. However, there may be situations when you need to test for several possible outcomes, which may require more than two possible outputs. To accomplish this, you need to create a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">nested IF function</a><span class="glossdef">Used when more than two tests and two outputs are required when using the IF function. A nested IF function is when the <strong class="emphasis bold">value_if_true</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">value_if_false</strong> arguments of an IF function are defined with another IF function.</span></span>. A nested IF function is when either the <strong class="emphasis bold">value_if_true</strong> or <strong class="emphasis bold">value_if_false</strong> arguments are defined with another IF function.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s07_p03">For the Personal Investment workbook, a nested IF function is required to complete the Rebalance Indicator column (Column O) on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Investment Detail</strong> worksheet (see <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s06_f02">Figure 3.19 "Results of the AND Function in the Logical Test Argument of an IF Function"</a>). The purpose of this column is to indicate where the portfolio needs to be rebalanced. Looking at the Current vs. Target column (Column N) shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s06_f02">Figure 3.19 "Results of the AND Function in the Logical Test Argument of an IF Function"</a>, you can see that several investments have a significant negative number where the investment value has fallen below the target percentage for the portfolio. Other investments have a significant positive number where the investment has exceeded the target percentage for the portfolio. For this portfolio, a number greater than 1% or less than –1% will be considered significant. Therefore, we will need to assess three possible outcomes when creating a logical test that evaluates the values in Column N. The first test will be if the value is greater than 1%. The second test will be if the value is less than –1%. The third test will be if both the first test and the second test are false. This is why we need to construct a nested IF function to produce the outputs in the Rebalance Indicator column. The following steps explain how to accomplish this:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s07_l01">
            <li>Click cell O4 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Investment Detail</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>Type an equal sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">=</strong>).</li>
            <li>Type the function name <strong class="emphasis bold">IF</strong> followed by an open parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">(</strong>).</li>
            <li>Click cell N4.</li>
            <li>Type the greater than symbol (<strong class="emphasis bold">&gt;</strong>) followed by the number <strong class="emphasis bold">1%</strong>. It is important to use the percent symbol (<strong class="emphasis bold">%</strong>) after the number 1. If you omit the percent symbol, Excel will test if the value in cell N4 is greater than 100%.</li>
            <li>Type a comma.</li>
            <li>Type the word <strong class="emphasis bold">Rebalance</strong> inside quotation marks. When using text data to define any of the arguments for the IF function, the text must be placed inside quotation marks.</li>
            <li>Type a comma.</li>
            <li>Start another IF function by typing the function name <strong class="emphasis bold">IF</strong> followed by an open parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">(</strong>).</li>
            <li>Click cell N4.</li>

            <li>Type two closing parentheses (<strong class="emphasis bold">))</strong>). Since two IF functions were started, there are two open parentheses in the function.

            <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s07_p04">If you are using a logical function to evaluate percentages in a cell location, be sure to use the percent symbol when defining the logical test. For example, if you are testing cell location B5 to determine if the value is greater than 10%, the logical test should appear as follows: <em class="emphasis">B5&gt;10%</em>. If you omit the percent sign, the logical test will evaluate cell B5 to see if the value is greater than 1000%. This may erroneously force the function to produce the <em class="emphasis">value_if_false</em> output. You can also convert the percentage to a decimal in the logical test. For example, in decimal form, the logical test can be constructed as follows: <em class="emphasis">B5&gt;.10</em>.</p>

            <p class="simpara">Use AND or OR functions within IF functions</p>
            <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s07_p06">The benefit of using the AND or OR functions within the IF function is that doing so reduces the need to construct lengthy nested IF functions. It becomes increasingly difficult to manage the accuracy of lengthy nested IF functions. The AND and OR functions allow you to test for a variety of conditions in a cell location, which can reduce the need to nest multiple IF functions. Examine the nested if function in cell O4 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Investment Detail</strong> worksheet. Can you recreate this without nesting the IF function?</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s08_p02">A feature related to the skills used to create logical functions is conditional formatting. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Conditional formats</a><span class="glossdef">An Excel feature that applies formatting commands to cell locations based on the cell contents. A basic conditional formatting rule will utilize a logical test to evaluate the contents of a cell location. If the results of the logical test are true, Excel will apply the designated formatting commands to the cell location.</span></span> allow you to apply a variety of formatting treatments based on the contents of a cell location. A logical test similar to the ones used in the IF, AND, and OR functions is used to evaluate the contents of a cell and apply a designated formatting treatment. For example, looking at <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s01_s07_f01">Figure 3.20 "Completed Nested IF Function"</a>, you will notice that the Unrealized Gain/Loss column is formatted using the accounting number format. Negative numbers are enclosed in parentheses. However, to make these numbers stand out, we can use conditional formatting to change the font color to red. We will do this for the Unrealized Gain/Loss and Percent Gain/Loss columns. The following steps explain how conditional formats are applied to the cell locations in these columns:</p>

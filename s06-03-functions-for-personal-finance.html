        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s01_p02">One of the functions we will add to the Personal Budget workbook is the PMT function. This function calculates the payments required for a loan or a lease. However, before demonstrating this function, it is important to cover a few fundamental concepts on loans and leases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s01_p03">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">loan</a><span class="glossdef">A contractual agreement in which money is borrowed from a lender and paid back over a specific period of time.</span></span> is a contractual agreement in which money is borrowed from a lender and paid back over a specific period of time. The amount of money that is borrowed from the lender is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">principal</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of money borrowed from a lender.</span></span> of the loan. The borrower is usually required to pay the principal of the loan plus interest. When you borrow money to buy a house, the loan is referred to as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mortgage</a><span class="glossdef">A loan used to purchase a home or property.</span></span>. This is because the house being purchased also serves as collateral to ensure payment. In other words, the bank can take possession of your house if you fail to make loan payments. As shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s01_t01">Table 2.5 "Key Terms for Loans and Leases"</a>, there are several key terms related to loans and leases.</p>

By law, a lender is required to provide an amortization table to a borrower.</span></span> for a loan. A lender is required by law to provide borrowers with an amortization table when a loan contract is offered. The table in the figure shows how the payments of a loan would work if you borrowed $100,000 from a lender and agreed to pay it back over 10 years at an interest rate of 5%. You will notice that each time you make a payment, you are paying the bank an interest fee plus some of the loan principal. Each year the amount of interest paid to the bank decreases and the amount of money used to pay off the principal increases. This is because the bank is charging you interest on the amount of principal that has not been paid. As you pay off the principal, the interest rate is applied to a lower number, which reduces your interest charges. Finally, the figure shows that the sum of the values in the Interest Payment column is $29,505. This is how much it costs you to borrow this money over 10 years. Indeed, borrowing money is not free. It is important to note that to simplify this example, the payments were calculated on an annual basis. However, most loan payments are made on a monthly basis.</p>

When you lease a car, the manufacturer or a leasing company retains ownership of the vehicle and you agree to make regular payments for a specific period of time. The amount of money you pay depends on the price of the car, the terms of the lease contract, and the car’s expected residual value at the end of the lease. The calculation of lease payments is similar to the calculation of loan payments. However, when you lease a car, you pay only the value of the car that is used. For example, suppose you are leasing a car that is priced at $25,000. The lease contract is for 4 years at an interest rate of 5%. The residual value of the car is $10,000. This means the car will lose $15,000 of its value over 4 years. Another way to state this is that the car will depreciate $15,000. A lease will be structured so that you pay this $15,000 in depreciation. However, the interest charges will be based on the purchase price of $25,000. We will look at a demonstration of leasing a car as well as buying a home in the next section.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s02_p02">If you own a home, your mortgage payments are a major component of your household budget. If you are planning to buy a home, having a clear understanding of your monthly payments is critical for maintaining strong financial health. In Excel, mortgage payments are conveniently calculated through the PMT (payment) function. This function is more complex than the statistical functions covered in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02">Section 2.2 "Statistical Functions"</a>. With statistical functions, you are required to add only a range of cells or selected cells within the parentheses of the function. With the PMT function, you must accurately define a series of arguments in order for the function to produce a reliable output. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s02_t01">Table 2.6 "Arguments for the PMT Function"</a> lists the arguments for the PMT function. It is helpful to review the key loan and lease terms in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s01_t01">Table 2.5 "Key Terms for Loans and Leases"</a> before reviewing the PMT function arguments.</p>

            <li>Type a minus sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">−</strong>). When defining the Pv argument of the PMT function, any cell location or value must be preceded with a minus sign.</li>
            <li>Click cell B2 on the worksheet. This is the principal of the loan.</li>
            <li>Press the ENTER key on your keyboard. You will now see the Rate, Nper, and Pv arguments defined for the function.</li>
            <li>Click the OK button at the bottom of the Function Arguments dialog box. The function will now be placed into the worksheet. Since we are not paying any lump sums of money at the end of the loan, there is no need to define the Fv argument. Also, we will assume that the monthly mortgage payments will be made at the end of each month. Therefore, there is no need to define the Type argument.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s03_p02">In addition to calculating the mortgage payments for a home, the PMT function will be used in the Personal Budget workbook to calculate the lease payments for a car. The details for the lease payments are found in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Car Lease Payments</strong> worksheet. Similar to the statistical functions, we can type the PMT function directly into a cell. However, you must know the definitions for each argument of the function and understand how these arguments need to be defined based on your objective. The terms for loans and leases are in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s01_t01">Table 2.5 "Key Terms for Loans and Leases"</a>, and the definitions for the arguments of the PMT function are in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s02_t01">Table 2.6 "Arguments for the PMT Function"</a>. The following steps explain how the PMT function is added to the Personal Budget workbook to calculate the lease payments for a car:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Click cell B6 in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Car Lease Payments</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>Type an equal sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">=</strong>).</li>
            <li>Type the letters <strong class="emphasis bold">PMT</strong>.</li>
            <li>Type an open parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">(</strong>).Excel then provides a tip box showing the arguments of the function.</li>
            <li>Click cell B4. This is the interest rate being charged for the lease.</li>
            <li>Type the forward slash (<strong class="emphasis bold">/</strong>) for division.</li>
            <li>Type the number <strong class="emphasis bold">12</strong>. Since our goal is to calculate the monthly lease payments, we divide the interest rate by 12 to convert the annual rate to a monthly rate.</li>
            <li>Type a comma. When you type a function containing arguments, you must separate each argument with a comma. This signals to Excel that one argument has been defined and you are ready to define the next argument in the function.</li>
            <li>Click cell B5. This is the term or the length of time for the lease contract. Since the term is already expressed in months, we can just reference cell B5 and move to the next argument.</li>
            <li>Type a comma. This advances the function to the Pv argument.</li>
            <li>Type a minus sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">−</strong>). Remember that cell locations or values used to define the Pv argument must be preceded with a minus sign.</li>
            <li>Click cell B2 on the worksheet, which is the price of the car.</li>
            <li>Type a comma. This advances the function to the [Fv] argument.</li>
            <li>Click cell B3 on the worksheet. This is the residual value of the car. Note that cell location and values used to define the [Fv] argument are NOT preceded by a minus sign.</li>
            <li>Type a comma. This advances the function to the [Type] argument.</li>
            <li>Type the number <strong class="emphasis bold">1</strong>. We will assume that the lease payments will be due at the beginning of each month.</li>
            <li>Type a closing parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong>).</li>

Cell references can also be used to display values or the outputs of formulas and functions in cell locations on other worksheets. This is how data will be displayed on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong> worksheet in the Personal Budget workbook. Outputs from the formulas and functions that were entered into the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Detail</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">Mortgage Payments</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">Car Lease Payments</strong> worksheets will be displayed on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong> worksheet through the use of cell references.

We will use the FV function in cell D10 of the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong> worksheet to calculate our savings plan projection.

The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">time value of money</a><span class="glossdef">The opportunity to increase the value of money over time through investments that provide a constant or average positive rate of return.</span></span> is the opportunity to grow your money over time given a constant or average rate of return. For example, consider the data shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s05_f01">Figure 2.40 "Time Value of Money Example for a One-Time Investment"</a>. This data assumes that a person makes a one-time investment of $100 in a bond mutual fund that returns 5% interest per year. Notice that the interest paid in Column E increases every year. This is because the interest is reinvested in the mutual fund, which increases the total value of the investment. For example, the interest earned in year 1 is based on a $100 investment. Therefore, the interest paid is $5.00, or 5% of $100. However, in year 2, when the $5.00 interest payment is reinvested, the total investment increases to $105. Therefore, in year 2 the interest paid increases to $5.25, or 5% of $105. The value of the investment at the end of 5 years is $127.63. This is the value that can be calculated using the FV function.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s06_p02">Establishing a personal savings plan is one of the most important financial exercises you can do. For example, a savings plan is critical for establishing financial security for your retirement years. Many people mistakenly believe that saving for retirement is something you do when you get older. However, the greatest financial gains for your retirement can be achieved if you start saving in the earliest years of your career. Now that you have an understanding of the time value of money, you can see that the more years you can earn interest on your investments and reinvest those earnings, the more money you will have when you retire. Savings plans are also important for other key life events, such as going to college or buying a home. The FV function is a convenient tool that can help you establish savings goals and project the value of your investments over time. Similar to the PMT function, the FV function requires you to accurately define specific arguments in order to produce a reliable result. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s06_t01">Table 2.8 "Arguments for the FV Function"</a> provides definitions for each of the arguments in the FV function. It is helpful to review the time value of money terms in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s05_t01">Table 2.7 "Key Terms for Time Value of Money Concepts"</a> before using the FV function.</p>

Notice that the current savings plan projection is $25,606. This is $606 higher than the target of $25,000 entered into cell D9, which shows that the current budget is working to achieve the goals of this savings plan. In other words, given the current net income, we are saving enough money to achieve our savings plan goals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s06_p06">There are two important factors to notice with regard to this plan. The first factor is that our spending plan allows us to save enough money so that it can be invested to achieve our target of $25,000. The second factor is that the expected rate of return is 3.5%. This is a relatively low expected rate of return and could be achieved by investing in relatively low-risk investments such as bonds as opposed to stocks. This rate can be considered good because we can achieve our savings goals without having to make high-risk investments that could result in a significant loss of our savings.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s07_p02">We used several formulas and functions to complete the Personal Budget workbook shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s06_f01">Figure 2.42 "Results of the Savings Plan Projections"</a>. All the formulas and functions entered contain cell references that allow for a variety of what-if scenarios. Goal Seek is a tool that can be used in the process of conducting these what-if scenarios. Goal Seek maximizes the benefits of Excel’s cell-referencing capabilities by changing inputs to precise values to achieve specific outputs produced by formulas or functions. We will begin by changing one of the inputs in the Personal Budget workbook through the following steps:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s07_l01">
            <li>Click the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Detail</strong> worksheet tab.</li>
            <li>Click cell D9.</li>
            <li>Type the number <strong class="emphasis bold">2000</strong>. Instead of planning a decrease in our vacation spending, we will see what happens to our budget if we spend the same amount as last year, which was $2,000.</li>
            <li>Press the ENTER key.</li>
        </ol>

By comparing these two figures you can see that by changing just one input, many of the outputs produced by the formulas and functions in the worksheet changed. The following is a list of the changes that occurred in the worksheet:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s07_p05">One of the most notable changes on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong> worksheet is the Savings Projection in cell D10. By spending an additional $500 a year on vacation plans, the projected savings value in 10 years decreases by $5,865. However, what if the rate of return were to increase? An increase in the rate of return could recover the decrease in the future value of our savings plan. We can use a tool such as Goal Seek to determine exactly how much the rate of return would have to increase to achieve our savings plan target of $25,000. The following steps explain how to use Goal Seek to accomplish this goal:</p>

Notice that in order to achieve the target savings plan of $25,000, the rate of return must increase to 7.8%. Initially, it appears that we can spend the additional $500 a year on vacations and still achieve our savings goal of $25,000. However, achieving a 7.8% annual rate of return will require us to make riskier investments with our savings. Thus, there is a greater possibility that we could lose a substantial amount of our savings. This is the downside of decreasing your overall savings rate. If you save less money, it forces you to take higher risks with the money you have in order to achieve higher rates of return. Unfortunately, many people end up on the losing end of these risks, which severely compromises their ability to reach their savings goals.</p>

                <li>The PMT function can be used to calculate the monthly mortgage payments for a house or the monthly lease payments for a car.</li>
                <li>When using the PMT or FV functions, each argument must be separated by a comma.</li>
                <li>When using the PMT or FV functions, the arguments must be defined in comparable terms. For example, when using the FV function, if the Pmt argument is defined using monthly payments, the Rate and Nper arguments must be defined in terms of months.</li>
                <li>The FV function is used to calculate the value an investment at a future point in time given a constant rate of return.</li>

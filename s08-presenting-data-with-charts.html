This chapter provides more details for enhancing the appearance of your charts and addresses how to choose the best chart type for your data. One of the most important things to consider when using charts in Excel is that they are intended to be used for communicating an idea to an audience. Your audience can be reading your charts in a written document or listening to you in a live presentation. In fact, Excel charts are often imported or pasted into Word documents or PowerPoint slides, which serve this very purpose of communicating ideas to an audience. Although there are no rules set in stone for using specific charts for certain data types, some chart types are designed to communicate certain messages better than others. This chapter explores numerous charts that can be used for a variety of purposes. In addition, we will examine formatting charts and using those charts in Word and PowerPoint documents.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_p01">This section reviews the most commonly used Excel chart types. To demonstrate the variety of chart types available in Excel, it is necessary to use a variety of data sets. Therefore, instead of addressing a specific theme, we will use a variety of themes. This is necessary not only to demonstrate the construction of charts but also to explain how to choose the right type of chart given your data and the idea you intend to communicate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_p02">Before we begin, let’s review a few key points you need to consider before creating any chart in Excel. The first is identifying your idea or message. It is important to keep in mind that the primary purpose of a chart is to present quantitative information to an audience. Therefore, you must first decide what message or idea you wish to present. This is critical in helping you select specific data from a worksheet that will be used in a chart. Throughout this chapter, we will reinforce the intended message first before creating each chart.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_p03">The second key point is selecting the right chart type. The chart type you select will depend on the data you have and the message you intend to communicate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_p04">The third key point is identifying the values that should appear on the X and Y axes. One of the ways to identify which values belong on the X and Y axes is to sketch the chart on paper first. If you can visualize what your chart is supposed to look like, you will have an easier time using Excel to construct an effective chart that accurately communicates your message. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_t01">Table 4.1 "Key Steps before Constructing an Excel Chart"</a> provides a brief summary of these points.</p>

        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_p05">Just because you have data in a worksheet does not mean it must all be placed onto a chart. When creating a chart, it is common for only specific data points to be used. To determine what data should be used when creating a chart, you must first identify the message or idea that you want to communicate to an audience.</p>

This is an aggregate price index of five hundred of the largest publicly traded companies. This chart will be used to communicate a simple message: to show how the index has performed over a fifty-two-week period. We can use this chart in a presentation to show whether stock prices have been increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant over the designated period of time.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s01_p03">Before we create the line chart, it is important to identify why it is an appropriate chart type given the message we wish to communicate and the data we have. When presenting the trend for any data over a designated period of time, the most commonly used chart types are the line chart and the column chart. With the column chart, you are limited to a certain number of bars or data points. As you increase the number of bars on a column chart, it becomes increasingly difficult to read. As you scroll through the data on the worksheet shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s01_f01">Figure 4.1 "52 Week Data for the S&amp;P 500 and Microsoft"</a>, you will see that there are fifty-two points of data used to construct the chart. This is generally too many data points to put on a column chart, which is why we are using a line chart. Our line chart will show the closing price for the S&amp;P 500 on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Y axis</a><span class="glossdef">The vertical axis of a chart.</span></span> and the week number on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">X axis</a><span class="glossdef">The horizontal axis of a chart.</span></span>. The following steps explain how to construct this chart:</p>

            <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s01_p04">We can use both a line chart and a column chart to illustrate a trend over time. However, a line chart is far more effective when there are many periods of time being measured. For example, if we are measuring fifty-two weeks, a column chart would require fifty-two bars. A general rule of thumb is to use a column chart when twenty bars or less are required. A column chart becomes difficult to read as the number of bars exceeds twenty.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s02_p02">After creating an Excel chart, you may find it necessary to adjust the scale of the Y axis. Excel automatically sets the maximum value for the Y axis based on the data used to create the chart. However, the minimum value is usually set to zero. Depending on the data you are using to create the chart, setting the minimum value to zero can substantially minimize the graphical presentation of a trend. For example, the trend shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s01_f04">Figure 4.4 "Line Chart Moved and Resized"</a> appears to be increasing slightly. However, the S&amp;P 500 increased by over 20% during this period, which is substantial. The presentation of this trend can be improved if the minimum value started at eight hundred. While it is certainly possible for the S&amp;P 500 to fall below eight hundred, it is most likely remote. The following steps explain how to make this adjustment to the Y axis:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Click anywhere on the Y axis on the <em class="emphasis">52 Week Trend for the S&amp;P 500</em> line chart (<strong class="emphasis bold">Stock Trend</strong> worksheet).</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s03_p02">We will now create a second line chart using the data in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Stock Trend</strong> worksheet. The purpose of this chart is to compare two trends: the change in value for the S&amp;P 500 and the Microsoft common stock. <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03#manzoexcel_1.1-ch03">Chapter 3 "Logical and Lookup Functions"</a> presented a personal investment portfolio where the investments were compared to a benchmark. The S&amp;P 500 is a benchmark that is commonly used to judge the performance of individual stocks. The purpose and message of this chart is to show whether Microsoft is performing better or worse than the S&amp;P 500 index. This type of analysis can be used to determine whether a stock should be sold, purchased, or held.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s03_p03">Before creating the chart to compare the S&amp;P 500 and Microsoft, it is important to review the data in the range E4:F55 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Stock Trend</strong> worksheet. We cannot use the price data for Microsoft and the S&amp;P 500 because the values are not comparable. That is, the data for Microsoft is in a range of $22.00 to $28.00, but the data for the S&amp;P 500 is in a range of 1,022 to 1,363. If we used these values to create a chart, we would not be able to see any substantial change in the trend for either the S&amp;P 500 or Microsoft. Therefore, formulas were used to calculate the percent change in value for the S&amp;P 500 and Microsoft for each week. For example, looking at cells E5 and F5 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Stock Trend</strong> worksheet, you see that the S&amp;P 500 increased 2.4% in week 2, whereas Microsoft increased 3.1%. The percent change calculations now provide an appropriate method of comparison. This is a very important step to consider when comparing trends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s03_p04">The construction of this second line chart will be similar to the first line chart. The X axis will be the 52 weeks in the range A4:A55. However, the Y axis will be the percentages in the range E4:F55. This creates a problem because Columns B, C, and D will not be used in this chart. Therefore, we cannot simply highlight one contiguous range of cells to create the chart. In this chapter we will demonstrate two options for charting data that is not in a contiguous range. The following steps demonstrate the first option:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s04_p02">A column chart is commonly used to show trends over time so long as the data are limited to approximately twenty points or less. For example, in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch01#manzoexcel_1.1-ch01">Chapter 1 "Fundamental Skills"</a> we showed a sales trend over a twelve-month period. Another common use for column charts is frequency distributions. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">frequency distribution</a><span class="glossdef">The number of occurrences for an established set of categories.</span></span> shows the number of occurrences by established categories. For example, a common frequency distribution used in most academic institutions is a grade distribution. A grade distribution shows the number of students that achieve each level of a typical grading scale (A, A−, B+, B, etc.). The <strong class="emphasis bold">Grade Distribution</strong> worksheet contains final grades for a hypothetical academic class. To show the grade frequency distribution, the numbers of students appear on the Y axis and the grade categories appear on the X axis. The following steps explain how to create this chart:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>Highlight the range A3:B8 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Grade Distribution</strong> worksheet. Column B shows the number of students that achieved a grade within the grade category shown in Column A.</li>

            <li>Click and drag the chart so the upper left corner is in the middle of cell H2.</li>
            <li>Resize the chart so the left side is locked to the left side of Column H, the right side is locked to the right side of Column P, the top is locked to the top of Row 2, and the bottom is locked to the bottom of Row 16.</li>
            <li>Click the legend one time and press the DELETE key on your keyboard. Since the chart presents only one data series, the legend is not necessary.</li>
            <li>Click the title of the chart twice so the cursor is placed in front of the word <em class="emphasis">Class</em>.</li>
            <li>Type the following in front of the word <em class="emphasis">Class</em>: <strong class="emphasis bold">Final Grades for the</strong>.</li>

            <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s04_p04">When using charts to show frequency distributions, the difference between a column chart and a bar chart is really a matter of preference. Both are very effective in showing frequency distributions. However, if you are showing a trend over a period of time, a column chart is preferred over a bar chart. This is because a period of time is typically shown horizontally, with the oldest date on the far left and the newest date on the far right. Therefore, the descriptive categories for the chart would have to fall on the X axis, which is the configuration of a column chart. On a bar chart, the descriptive categories are displayed vertically along the Y axis.</p>

Charts can also be placed in a dedicated worksheet called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chart sheet</a><span class="glossdef">An Excel worksheet that is designated for a chart.</span></span>. It is called a chart sheet because it can contain only an Excel chart. Chart sheets are useful if you need to create several charts using the data in a single worksheet. If you embed several charts in one worksheet, it can be cumbersome to navigate and browse through the charts. It is easier to browse through charts when they are moved to a chart sheet because a separate sheet tab is added to the workbook for each chart.

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s07_p02">The next chart we will demonstrate is a pie chart. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pie chart</a><span class="glossdef">A chart used to show the percent of total for each component of a data set.</span></span> is used to show a percent of total for a data set at a specific point in time. The data we will use to demonstrate a pie chart is related to the overall spending activity in the health-care industry. The <strong class="emphasis bold">Health Care</strong> worksheet contains data that shows total spending in the United States for the years 1969 and 2009. In 1969, the total amount spent in the United States for health-related expenses was over $66 billion. The pie chart shows how this $66 billion was funded.

You can quickly see that Health Insurance and Out of Pocket made up the majority of health-care spending in 1969. Similar to the column chart, the key to creating an effective pie chart is the number of categories presented on the chart. Although there are no specific limits for the number of categories you can use on a pie chart, a good rule of thumb is ten or less. As the number of categories exceeds ten, it becomes more difficult to identify key categories that make up the majority of the total. In this example, it is easy to see that two categories compose 75% of the total.</p>

However, the Health Insurance category increased significantly from 1969 to 2009. Overall, the chart shows that the total out-of-pocket and health insurance expense increased significantly from 1969 to 2009. These two categories made up approximately 75% of total health-care spending in 1969. By 2009, these two categories increased to over 80% of total health-care spending.</p>

                <li>Identifying the message you wish to convey to an audience is a critical first step in creating an Excel chart.</li>
                <li>Both a column chart and a line chart can be used to present a trend over a period of time. However, a line chart is preferred over a column chart when presenting data over long periods of time.</li>
                <li>The number of bars on a column chart should be limited to approximately twenty bars or less.</li>
                <li>For column, line, and bar charts, the X axis can be used only for labels, not for numeric values.</li>
                <li>When creating a chart to compare trends, the values for each data series must be within a reasonable range. If there is a wide variance between the values in the two data series (two times or more), the percent change should be calculated with respect to the first data point for each series.</li>
                <li>When working with frequency distributions, the use of a column chart or a bar chart is a matter of preference. However, a column chart is preferred when working with a trend over a period of time.</li>
                <li>A pie chart is used to present the percent of total for a data set.</li>
                <li>A stacked column chart is used to show how a percent total changes over time.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s02_p01">You can use a variety of formatting techniques to enhance the appearance of a chart once you have created it. Formatting commands are applied to a chart for the same reason they are applied to a worksheet: they make the chart easier to read. However, formatting techniques also help you qualify and explain the data in a chart. For example, you can add footnotes explaining the data source as well as notes that clarify the type of numbers being presented (i.e., if the numbers in a chart are truncated, you can state whether they are in thousands, millions, etc.). These notes are also helpful in answering questions if you are using charts in a live presentation. We will demonstrate these formatting techniques using the column chart and stacked column chart from the previous section.</p>

            <li>Activate the Y axis and apply the same formatting adjustments as stated in step 3.</li>
            <li>Add a Y axis title using the Rotated Title option. In the Format tab under the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon, select the first preset style option, Colored Outline - Black, Dark 1, in the Shape Styles group of commands. Then, in the Home tab of the Ribbon, change the font style to Arial and the font size to 14 points.</li>
            <li>Change the wording of the Y axis title to read <strong class="emphasis bold">Percent of Total Annual Spend</strong>.</li>
            <li>Activate the title of the chart by clicking it once. In the Format tab under the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon, select the first preset style option, Colored Outline - Black, Dark 1, in the Shape Styles group of commands. Then, in the Home tab of the Ribbon, change the font style to Arial.</li>

What makes this chart different from the other charts demonstrated in this chapter is that values are used on both the X and Y axes. So far, the charts we have demonstrated in this chapter use categories or qualitative labels for the X axis. This means that the distance between each category on the X axis will always be the same, even if numbers are used. In a scatter chart, the X axis operates just like the Y axis. In other words, the distance between the values on the X axis will vary depending on the value of the number. Depending on the format, we can create the scatter chart to look just like a line chart. Since both the X and Y axes contain quantitative values, the scatter chart is a valuable tool for studying various shapes or functional forms for a line chart. In fact, a common feature used with the scatter chart is the trendline and equation. Excel can evaluate the line that is produced on a scatter chart and produce a mathematical equation. We will demonstrate these features in this section.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_p02">A common use for a scatter chart is the study of supply and demand curves. This is because the data points for both the supply and demand lines require quantitative values on both the X and Y axes. The Y axis contains the price of a certain good or item; the X axis contains the quantity sold for that good or item. Fundamental economic laws state that as prices rise, sellers are willing to increase supply and sell more goods. However, the reverse is true for consumers. As prices rise, consumers purchase fewer goods. The <strong class="emphasis bold">Supply &amp; Demand</strong> worksheet contains hypothetical data for the supply and demand of breakfast cereal. There are ten data points to show the change in supply and demand as the price changes in Column A. The values you see in Columns A through C are formula outputs that are driven by the percentage in cell C14. For example, if the percentage in cell C14 is changed to 10, each price listed in Column A will increase, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_f01">Figure 4.45 "Hypothetical Supply and Demand Data"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_p03">We will use the scatter chart to study the change in quantity supplied and demanded as the price increases over ten data points, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_f01">Figure 4.45 "Hypothetical Supply and Demand Data"</a>. For many of the charts demonstrated in this chapter, we were able to highlight a range of cells and insert the chart type we needed. This was especially the case when the data was in a contiguous range of cells. However, this method rarely works when creating a scatter chart, even if the data are in a contiguous range. As a result, the method we present here starts with a blank chart and demonstrates how each data series is added to the chart individually. The following steps explain how we create this chart:</p>

            <p class="simpara">For Scatter Charts, Start with a Blank Chart</p>
            <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_p05">When creating a scatter chart, it is best to start with a blank chart and add each data series individually. This is because Excel will not always guess correctly which values belong on the X and Y axes since both contain numbers. For other chart types, such as column or line charts, the X axis contains nonnumeric data so it’s easy for Excel to configure the chart you need.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_p06"><a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_f04">Figure 4.48 "Scatter Chart Showing One Price"</a> shows the appearance of the scatter chart before any formatting enhancements are applied. Notice only two plot points are located on the chart. This is because the price change value in cell C14 is still zero. Therefore, the data are not reflecting any change in price, quantity demanded, or quantity supplied. The chart shows that at the current price of $1.50, suppliers are willing to provide fewer units compared with the number of units consumers are willing to buy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s02_p02">For all the charts demonstrated in this chapter, Excel has automatically established the scale for the Y axis. For scatter charts, Excel has also established the scale for the X axis. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">axis scale</a><span class="glossdef">The minimum and maximum value that appears on the X or Y axis of a chart.</span></span> is the minimum and maximum value that appears on an axis. For example, in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_f07">Figure 4.51 "Scatter Chart with Price Change at 14%"</a>, the Y axis scale is set to a minimum value of zero and a maximum value of 6.00. Although this is a very convenient feature of Excel, you may want to change the scale in some instances. If you change the value in cell C14 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Supply &amp; Demand</strong> worksheet, the lines jump or shift on the plot area of the chart. This is because Excel keeps rearranging the scale of both the X and Y axes. When studying the shape of lines, it is best to set the scale so it does not change. The following steps explain how to accomplish this:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>Change the value in cell C14 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Supply &amp; Demand</strong> worksheet to zero.</li>
            <li>Click anywhere on the Y axis of the chart.</li>
            <li>Click the Format Selection button in the Layout tab of the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon. This opens the Format Axis dialog box.</li>
            <li>Click the Fixed option next to the Minimum setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box. This ensures that the minimum value for the Y axis will always be zero.</li>
            <li>Click the Fixed option next to the Maximum setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box.</li>
            <li>Click in the input box next to the Maximum setting. Remove the 1.6 and enter the number <strong class="emphasis bold">5.0</strong>. We will not be studying the behavior of supply and demand beyond a $5.00 price point, so there is no need to extend the Y axis beyond this point.</li>
            <li>Click the Fixed option next to the Major Unit setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box.</li>
            <li>Click in the input box next to the Major Unit setting and change the value from 0.2 to 0.5 (see <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s02_f01">Figure 4.52 "Setting the Y Axis Scale"</a>). This allows us to measure the plot points in $0.50 intervals along the Y axis. When the axis extends to $5.00, $0.20 intervals may place too many values along the Y axis, making it difficult to read.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Click the Close button at the bottom of the Format Axis dialog box.</p>

            <li>Click the Fixed option next to the Maximum setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box.</li>
            <li>Click in the input box next to the Maximum setting. Remove the 500.0 and enter the number <strong class="emphasis bold">450.0</strong>. The number of units supplied or demanded will not exceed 450 based on the price points in our study. There is no need to extend the X axis to 500.</li>
            <li>Click the Fixed option next to the Major Unit setting under the Axis Options in the Format Axis dialog box.</li>
            <li>Click in the input box next to the Major Unit setting and change the value from 100.0 to 50.0. This allows us to measure the plot points in 50-unit intervals along the X axis.</li>
            <li>Click the Close button at the bottom of the Format Axis dialog box.</li>
            <li>Change the value in cell C14 to 2. Then change it to 4 and then to 8. Change the value one more time to 14. As you change the values in cell C14, the lines change but they no longer jump or shift since the scale of both axes is fixed.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_p02">A trendline can be applied to a chart to estimate or predict where plot points may occur at various points along the X and Y axes. Excel enables you to add a trendline to a chart and also provides the equation you can use to plot additional points. The following steps explain how to accomplish this:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Set the value in cell C14 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Supply &amp; Demand</strong> worksheet to 14.</li>

            <li>Click the Trendline button in the Layout tab of the Ribbon. Select the Linear Trendline option from the drop-down list.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Select the Demand option from the Add Trendline dialog box and click the OK button. This adds a new line to the plot area of the chart as well as the legend.</p>

Notice that the line goes through only two points on the demand line. This indicates that this trendline may <em class="emphasis">not</em> be a good fit for the line that has been created on the chart.</p>

As shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_f01">Figure 4.54 "Adding a Linear Trendline"</a>, the linear trendline is not a good fit for the shape of the demand line. The remaining steps will demonstrate how to remove a trendline and access more trendline options:</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click the Trendline button in the Layout tab of the Ribbon. Select the None option from the drop-down list. This removes the trendline from the chart.</li>
            <li>Click the Trendline button in the Layout tab of the Ribbon again. This time, select More Trendline Options from the drop-down list.</li>
            <li>Select the Demand option from the Add Trendline dialog box and click OK. This opens the Format Trendline dialog box.</li>
            <li>Select the Power option from the Format Trendline dialog box.</li>
            <li>Click the “Display Equation on chart” option at the bottom of the Format Trendline dialog box (see <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_f02">Figure 4.55 "The Format Trendline Dialog Box"</a>).</li>

Notice that the line fits perfectly over the demand series in the plot area. In fact, it may be difficult to see the line in the figure. This indicates that the trendline is an excellent fit for the demand line. As a result, we can be confident in using this line to predict other demand values along the X and Y axes. You can also see that the equation for this trendline has been added to the plot area of the chart. We can use the equation to calculate the price for each quantity value substituted for X. For example, if the number 150 is substituted for X in the equation, the result is a price of $2.59. Based on the values used to create the chart, this result appears to be accurate.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s04_s01_p02">Excel charts can be valuable tools for explaining quantitative data in a written report. Reports that address business plans, public policies, budgets, and so on all involve quantitative data. For this example, we will assume that the Change in Health Care Spend Source stacked column chart (see <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s02#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s02_s06_f06">Figure 4.44 "Completed Stacked Column Chart with Annotations"</a>) is being used in a written policy report. The following steps demonstrate how to paste an image, or picture, of this chart into a Word document:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s04_s01_l01">
            <li>Click below the figure heading in the Word document that reads: <em class="emphasis">Figure 6: Health Care Spending in the U.S.</em> The image of the stacked column chart will be placed below this heading.</li>
            <li>Open the Excel Objective 4.16 follow-along file.</li>
            <li>Activate the Change in Health Care Spend Source chart in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Health Spending Chart</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.</li>
            <li>Go back to the Excel Objective 4.17 Word document by clicking the file in the taskbar.</li>
            <li>Click the drop-down arrow below the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon. Click the Picture option from the drop-down list, which is the last option on the far right (see <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s04_s01_f01">Figure 4.57 "Paste Picture Option for Word"</a>).</li>
            <li>Click anywhere on the picture of the chart to activate it.</li>

It is best to use either the Shape Width or Shape Height buttons to reduce the size of the chart. Using either button automatically reduces the height and width of the chart in proper proportion. If you choose to use the sizing handles to resize the chart, holding the SHIFT key while clicking and dragging on a corner sizing handle will also keep the chart in proper proportion.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s04_s02_p02">Microsoft PowerPoint is perhaps the most commonly used tool for delivering live presentations. The charts used in a live presentation are critical for efficiently delivering your ideas to an audience. Similar to written documents, a wide range of presentations may require the explanation of quantitative data. This demonstration includes a PowerPoint slide that could be used in a presentation for setting prices for a hypothetical breakfast cereal company. We will paste the scatter chart showing the supply and demand for breakfast cereal into this PowerPoint slide. However, instead of pasting an image, as demonstrated in the Word document, we will establish a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">link</a><span class="glossdef">A dynamic connection between two files, worksheets, or cell locations. Any change in the source file will be reflected in the file, worksheet, or cell that contains the link.</span></span> to the Excel file. As a result, if we change the chart in the Excel file, the change will be reflected in the PowerPoint file. The following steps explain how to accomplish this:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s04_s02_l01">
            <li>Open the Excel Objective 4.16 follow-along file.</li>
            <li>Activate the scatter chart in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Supply &amp; Demand</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.</li>
            <li>Go back to the Excel Objective 4.18 PowerPoint file by clicking the file in the taskbar.</li>
            <li>Click the down arrow below the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon in the PowerPoint file.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Select the Keep Source Formatting &amp; Link Data option from the drop-down list (see <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s04_s02_f01">Figure 4.60 "Creating a Link to an Excel Chart in PowerPoint"</a>). This pastes an image of the Excel chart into the PowerPoint slide. In addition, a link is created so that any changes made to the chart appear on the PowerPoint slide.</p>

        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 1 Easy</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_p02">If you are contemplating a career in the fashion industry, you will likely be working with an apparel size analysis report. Understanding the most commonly purchased sizes is critical for any company in the fashion industry. For example, in the apparel manufacturing industry, you have to know how many units to manufacture in each size for a particular garment. In addition, you have to know the exact garment specifications for the sizes small, medium, large, and so on. If you are pursuing a career on the retail side of the fashion industry, your job may be a little more complicated. You have to know how many units of each size of a particular garment to ship to each store. There is nothing more devastating to a fashion company’s sales than luring customers into a store with a great-looking garment and not having their sizes available. The charts presented in this chapter can be valuable tools in analyzing size information for garments. This exercise uses the concept of the frequency distribution and frequency comparison to analyze demand by garment size for the knit tops department of an apparel manufacturing company. The information displayed on these charts can be used to establish the production plan for manufacturing the garments for this department.

        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 2 Moderate</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_p03">The following exercise continues the fashion industry theme that was presented in part A of this exercise. In this exercise, we focus on the retail side of the fashion industry. Markdowns are a critical component for operating a successful fashion retail business. When an item is marked down, the price is reduced by a certain amount with the expectation that it will increase the number of units sold. This is also known as putting an item on sale. You have probably seen, and perhaps taken advantage of, these sales during a visit to your local mall. A surplus of inventory can present considerable losses for a fashion retailer. Therefore, the timing and the amount of discount taken on an item is critical in managing the inventory for these companies. The increase in the number of units sold will depend on the size of the discount offered on a particular item. The scatter chart demonstrated in this chapter is a valuable tool in analyzing the rate at which unit sales increase when discounts are offered on an item. Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 1 or continue with this file if you completed Comprehensive Review Part A.</p>

        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 2 Moderate</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_p04">Excel can be a valuable tool for constructing a personal budget. As mentioned in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02">Chapter 2 "Mathematical Computations"</a>, developing a personal budget is an important exercise for establishing a path to financial security. One of the benefits of developing and maintaining a personal budget is that it allows you to maintain a healthy level of savings. Money that you save can be used to buy personal items. However, it can also be used to sustain your everyday expenses in the event you lose a job or source of income. Without a reasonable level of savings, you may be forced to borrow money, which could come at very high interest expenses in the form of credit cards. Once you accumulate large debt balances at high interest rates, it can take years to pay off that debt, and the interest expense that you pay reduces savings for more important purposes such as college or retirement. What most people do not realize is that even what appears to be the most trivial overage in spending can rapidly eliminate any savings and quickly turn into debt. The purpose of this exercise is to use the charts in this chapter to evaluate a personal expense plan and to analyze the relationship that spending and net income have on your ability to save money. Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 2.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_l06">
            <li>Create a pie chart using the data in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Expense Plan</strong> worksheet. The chart should show the percent of total for the categories in the range A3:A10 based on the Annual Spend values in the range D3:D10. Use the Exploded Pie in 3-D format.</li>
            <li>Move the pie chart to a separate chart sheet. The tab name for the chart sheet should read <strong class="emphasis bold">Expense Chart</strong>.</li>
            <li>Remove the legend from the chart.</li>
            <li>Edit the title of the chart to read <strong class="emphasis bold">Personal Expenses</strong>. Format the chart title with an Arial font style, bold, italics, and font size of 20 points.</li>
            <li>Add data labels to each section of the pie chart. Show only the category name and the percentage. Format the percentage to show one decimal place.</li>
            <li>Format the data labels with an Arial font style, bold, and font size of 14 points. Notice that the mortgage and tax categories make up over 50% of total expenses.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula into cell D4 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Savings</strong> worksheet. Your formula should add to the savings balance in cell D2 the result of subtracting the spending value in cell C4 from the net income value in cell B4.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula into cell D5 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Savings</strong> worksheet. Your formula should add to the output in cell D4 the result of subtracting the spending value in cell C5 from the net income value in cell B5. Copy this formula and paste it into the range D6:D15 using the Paste Formulas command.</li>
            <li>Create a line chart using the data in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Savings</strong> worksheet. The chart should show the months in the range A4:A15 along the X axis. The Y axis should show the dollar amounts in the range B4:D15. There should be three data series displayed on the chart: Net Income, Spending, and Savings. Use the Line with Markers format option.</li>

            <li>Add a title to the Y axis that reads <strong class="emphasis bold">After Tax Dollars</strong>. Use the Rotated Title alignment option. Format the title with the Subtle Effect - Red, Accent 2 preset shape style. Then, change the font style to Arial and change the font size to 12 points. Move the title if needed so it is on the far left of the chart area and centered along the Y axis.</li>
            <li>Format the X and Y axes by changing the font style to Arial, making the font bold, and changing the font size to 12 points.</li>
            <li>Change the scale of the Y axis so the minimum value is set to −500.</li>
            <li>Move the legend up so it is aligned with the $4,500 line of the plot area. Expand the width of the legend so it extends to the far right side of the chart area. Then format the legend by changing the font style to Arial and making the font bold.</li>
            <li>Change the color of the chart area to White, Background 1, Darker 15%, which is a shade of gray.</li>
            <li>Add an annotation that begins approximately one inch above the Dec label on the X axis. The annotation should extend approximately one and one-quarter inches wide and approximately one-quarter inch in height. The annotation should read <strong class="emphasis bold">Debt Incurred</strong>. Format the annotation by changing the font style to Arial, bold, italics, and font size of 12 points.</li>

Your firm helps people make investment decisions and establish plans for key life events such as saving for college, retirement, and so on. An intern who is working for the firm is evaluating the profit trends for two companies: Big Company and Goode Company. He sends you an Excel workbook and explains the following with respect to his analysis:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_l07">
            <li>I put a chart together to compare the earnings for the two companies. There is really nothing to look at. Big Company’s profits are so much larger than those for the Goode Company. Based on this chart, I don’t see how we would advise our clients to invest in the Goode Company. We should probably stick with the Big Company.</li>
            <li>Just so you know, the profit numbers on the chart are in thousands. Otherwise, it is a pretty straightforward column chart. I put the profits the companies earned for each quarter on the Y axis and the quarters are shown on the X axis.</li>

            <li>Look at the profit values for the two companies. Does it make sense to compare these values? If not, explain why and what alternatives you could pursue. Place your answer in the <strong class="emphasis bold">AnswerSheet</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>The analyst mentioned that the profit numbers are in terms of thousands. Would this be apparent by looking at the chart? If not, why? Place your answer in the <strong class="emphasis bold">AnswerSheet</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>Looking at the X axis of the column chart, you will see that the quarters keep repeating 1 through 4 for each year in Column A. Can anything be done to show the year that each set of four quarters represents? Place your answer in the <strong class="emphasis bold">AnswerSheet</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>Move the chart created by the analyst to a separate chart sheet and label the sheet tab <strong class="emphasis bold">Analyst’s Chart</strong>.

        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_p10">The purpose of this exercise is to analyze how cost changes in the operations of a quality control department impact the overall cost of quality for a manufacturing company. The <strong class="emphasis bold">Quality Control</strong> worksheet contains two years of cost data for four components of a quality control department: prevention, inspection, internal failure, and external failure. You will see that total quality costs decreased from year 1 to year 2. Create a chart that you believe is most appropriate to present the change in costs from one year to the next. The requirements are as follows:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_l10">
            <li>The chart should show which components are increasing or decreasing from year 1 to year 2. In addition, the dollar value for each component should appear on the chart for each year.</li>
            <li>The total quality control costs for each year should be specified on the chart.</li>
            <li>The chart should appear in a separate chart sheet.</li>
            <li>You should include appropriate formatting techniques covered in this chapter.</li>

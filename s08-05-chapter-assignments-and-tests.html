        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 1 Easy</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_p02">If you are contemplating a career in the fashion industry, you will likely be working with an apparel size analysis report. Understanding the most commonly purchased sizes is critical for any company in the fashion industry. For example, in the apparel manufacturing industry, you have to know how many units to manufacture in each size for a particular garment. In addition, you have to know the exact garment specifications for the sizes small, medium, large, and so on. If you are pursuing a career on the retail side of the fashion industry, your job may be a little more complicated. You have to know how many units of each size of a particular garment to ship to each store. There is nothing more devastating to a fashion company’s sales than luring customers into a store with a great-looking garment and not having their sizes available. The charts presented in this chapter can be valuable tools in analyzing size information for garments. This exercise uses the concept of the frequency distribution and frequency comparison to analyze demand by garment size for the knit tops department of an apparel manufacturing company. The information displayed on these charts can be used to establish the production plan for manufacturing the garments for this department. Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 1.</p>

        <p class="simpara">Starter File: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gone.2012books.lardbucket.org/sites/all/files/ManzoExcel_1.0_Chapter_4_CiP_Exercise_1.xlsx">Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 1</a> (Continued from Comprehensive Review Part A)</p>
        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 2 Moderate</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_p03">The following exercise continues the fashion industry theme that was presented in part A of this exercise. In this exercise, we focus on the retail side of the fashion industry. Markdowns are a critical component for operating a successful fashion retail business. When an item is marked down, the price is reduced by a certain amount with the expectation that it will increase the number of units sold. This is also known as putting an item on sale. You have probably seen, and perhaps taken advantage of, these sales during a visit to your local mall. A surplus of inventory can present considerable losses for a fashion retailer. Therefore, the timing and the amount of discount taken on an item is critical in managing the inventory for these companies. The increase in the number of units sold will depend on the size of the discount offered on a particular item. The scatter chart demonstrated in this chapter is a valuable tool in analyzing the rate at which unit sales increase when discounts are offered on an item. Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 1 or continue with this file if you completed Comprehensive Review Part A.</p>

Notice that when a discount is offered up to 20% off the original price, there is very little change in the number of units sold. This is typical in the fashion industry. If customers are not willing to pay full price for a particular style or color, it usually takes a substantial discount to convince them to buy.</li>

        <p class="simpara">Personal Spending and Savings Plan</p>
        <p class="simpara">Starter File: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gone.2012books.lardbucket.org/sites/all/files/ManzoExcel_1.0_Chapter_4_CiP_Exercise_2.xlsx">Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 2</a></p>
        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 2 Moderate</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_p04">Excel can be a valuable tool for constructing a personal budget. As mentioned in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02">Chapter 2 "Mathematical Computations"</a>, developing a personal budget is an important exercise for establishing a path to financial security. One of the benefits of developing and maintaining a personal budget is that it allows you to maintain a healthy level of savings. Money that you save can be used to buy personal items. However, it can also be used to sustain your everyday expenses in the event you lose a job or source of income. Without a reasonable level of savings, you may be forced to borrow money, which could come at very high interest expenses in the form of credit cards. Once you accumulate large debt balances at high interest rates, it can take years to pay off that debt, and the interest expense that you pay reduces savings for more important purposes such as college or retirement. What most people do not realize is that even what appears to be the most trivial overage in spending can rapidly eliminate any savings and quickly turn into debt. The purpose of this exercise is to use the charts in this chapter to evaluate a personal expense plan and to analyze the relationship that spending and net income have on your ability to save money. Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 2.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_l06">
            <li>Create a pie chart using the data in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Expense Plan</strong> worksheet. The chart should show the percent of total for the categories in the range A3:A10 based on the Annual Spend values in the range D3:D10. Use the Exploded Pie in 3-D format.</li>
            <li>Move the pie chart to a separate chart sheet. The tab name for the chart sheet should read <strong class="emphasis bold">Expense Chart</strong>.</li>
            <li>Remove the legend from the chart.</li>
            <li>Edit the title of the chart to read <strong class="emphasis bold">Personal Expenses</strong>. Format the chart title with an Arial font style, bold, italics, and font size of 20 points.</li>
            <li>Add data labels to each section of the pie chart. Show only the category name and the percentage. Format the percentage to show one decimal place.</li>
            <li>Format the data labels with an Arial font style, bold, and font size of 14 points. Notice that the mortgage and tax categories make up over 50% of total expenses.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula into cell D4 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Savings</strong> worksheet. Your formula should add to the savings balance in cell D2 the result of subtracting the spending value in cell C4 from the net income value in cell B4.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula into cell D5 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Savings</strong> worksheet. Your formula should add to the output in cell D4 the result of subtracting the spending value in cell C5 from the net income value in cell B5. Copy this formula and paste it into the range D6:D15 using the Paste Formulas command.</li>
            <li>Create a line chart using the data in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Savings</strong> worksheet. The chart should show the months in the range A4:A15 along the X axis. The Y axis should show the dollar amounts in the range B4:D15. There should be three data series displayed on the chart: Net Income, Spending, and Savings. Use the Line with Markers format option.</li>
            <li>Move the chart so the upper left corner is in the center of cell F3.</li>
            <li>Resize the chart so the left side is locked to the left side of Column F, the right side is locked to the right side of Column O, the top is locked to the top of Row 3, and the bottom is locked to the bottom of Row 18.</li>
            <li>Add a chart title above the plot area that reads <strong class="emphasis bold">Savings Analysis</strong>. Format the title with the Subtle Effect - Red, Accent 2 preset shape style. Then change the font style to Arial, bold, and italics.</li>
            <li>Add a title to the Y axis that reads <strong class="emphasis bold">After Tax Dollars</strong>. Use the Rotated Title alignment option. Format the title with the Subtle Effect - Red, Accent 2 preset shape style. Then, change the font style to Arial and change the font size to 12 points. Move the title if needed so it is on the far left of the chart area and centered along the Y axis.</li>
            <li>Format the X and Y axes by changing the font style to Arial, making the font bold, and changing the font size to 12 points.</li>
            <li>Change the scale of the Y axis so the minimum value is set to −500.</li>
            <li>Move the legend up so it is aligned with the $4,500 line of the plot area. Expand the width of the legend so it extends to the far right side of the chart area. Then format the legend by changing the font style to Arial and making the font bold.</li>
            <li>Change the color of the chart area to White, Background 1, Darker 15%, which is a shade of gray.</li>
            <li>Add an annotation that begins approximately one inch above the Dec label on the X axis. The annotation should extend approximately one and one-quarter inches wide and approximately one-quarter inch in height. The annotation should read <strong class="emphasis bold">Debt Incurred</strong>. Format the annotation by changing the font style to Arial, bold, italics, and font size of 12 points.</li>
            <li>Save the workbook by adding your name in front of the current workbook name (i.e., “<em class="emphasis">your name</em> Chapter 4 CiP Exercise 2”).</li>

        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_l07">
            <li>I put a chart together to compare the earnings for the two companies. There is really nothing to look at. Big Company’s profits are so much larger than those for the Goode Company.

        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s05_p09">The purpose of this exercise is to analyze the activity and cost data for a hotel using a scatter chart. The data provided in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Hotel Costs</strong> worksheet can be used to establish a trendline on a scatter chart. The equation for the trendline can then be used to determine what the hotel may incur with regard to cleaning costs at different levels of occupancy. This is an alternative to the High Low method presented in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02">Chapter 2 "Mathematical Computations"</a>. Your assignment is to create the scatter chart and construct a formula that can be used for planning cleaning costs at different levels of occupancy based on the following requirements:</p>

What makes this chart different from the other charts demonstrated in this chapter is that values are used on both the X and Y axes. So far, the charts we have demonstrated in this chapter use categories or qualitative labels for the X axis. This means that the distance between each category on the X axis will always be the same, even if numbers are used. In a scatter chart, the X axis operates just like the Y axis. In other words, the distance between the values on the X axis will vary depending on the value of the number. Depending on the format, we can create the scatter chart to look just like a line chart. Since both the X and Y axes contain quantitative values, the scatter chart is a valuable tool for studying various shapes or functional forms for a line chart. In fact, a common feature used with the scatter chart is the trendline and equation. Excel can evaluate the line that is produced on a scatter chart and produce a mathematical equation. We will demonstrate these features in this section.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_p02">A common use for a scatter chart is the study of supply and demand curves. This is because the data points for both the supply and demand lines require quantitative values on both the X and Y axes. The Y axis contains the price of a certain good or item; the X axis contains the quantity sold for that good or item. Fundamental economic laws state that as prices rise, sellers are willing to increase supply and sell more goods. However, the reverse is true for consumers. As prices rise, consumers purchase fewer goods. The <strong class="emphasis bold">Supply &amp; Demand</strong> worksheet contains hypothetical data for the supply and demand of breakfast cereal. There are ten data points to show the change in supply and demand as the price changes in Column A. The values you see in Columns A through C are formula outputs that are driven by the percentage in cell C14. For example, if the percentage in cell C14 is changed to 10, each price listed in Column A will increase, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_f01">Figure 4.45 "Hypothetical Supply and Demand Data"</a>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_p03">We will use the scatter chart to study the change in quantity supplied and demanded as the price increases over ten data points, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_f01">Figure 4.45 "Hypothetical Supply and Demand Data"</a>. For many of the charts demonstrated in this chapter, we were able to highlight a range of cells and insert the chart type we needed. This was especially the case when the data was in a contiguous range of cells. However, this method rarely works when creating a scatter chart, even if the data are in a contiguous range. As a result, the method we present here starts with a blank chart and demonstrates how each data series is added to the chart individually. The following steps explain how we create this chart:</p>

            <li>Change the value in cell C14 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Supply &amp; Demand</strong> worksheet to zero.</li>
            <li>Activate cell E1 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Supply &amp; Demand</strong> worksheet. It is important to note that this cell location is not adjacent to any data on the worksheet.</li>

            <p class="simpara">For Scatter Charts, Start with a Blank Chart</p>
            <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_p05">When creating a scatter chart, it is best to start with a blank chart and add each data series individually. This is because Excel will not always guess correctly which values belong on the X and Y axes since both contain numbers. For other chart types, such as column or line charts, the X axis contains nonnumeric data so it’s easy for Excel to configure the chart you need.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_p06"><a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_f04">Figure 4.48 "Scatter Chart Showing One Price"</a> shows the appearance of the scatter chart before any formatting enhancements are applied. Notice only two plot points are located on the chart. This is because the price change value in cell C14 is still zero. Therefore, the data are not reflecting any change in price, quantity demanded, or quantity supplied. The chart shows that at the current price of $1.50, suppliers are willing to provide fewer units compared with the number of units consumers are willing to buy.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s02_p02">For all the charts demonstrated in this chapter, Excel has automatically established the scale for the Y axis. For scatter charts, Excel has also established the scale for the X axis. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">axis scale</a><span class="glossdef">The minimum and maximum value that appears on the X or Y axis of a chart.</span></span> is the minimum and maximum value that appears on an axis. For example, in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s01_f07">Figure 4.51 "Scatter Chart with Price Change at 14%"</a>, the Y axis scale is set to a minimum value of zero and a maximum value of 6.00. Although this is a very convenient feature of Excel, you may want to change the scale in some instances. If you change the value in cell C14 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Supply &amp; Demand</strong> worksheet, the lines jump or shift on the plot area of the chart. This is because Excel keeps rearranging the scale of both the X and Y axes. When studying the shape of lines, it is best to set the scale so it does not change. The following steps explain how to accomplish this:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s02_l01">

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_p02">A trendline can be applied to a chart to estimate or predict where plot points may occur at various points along the X and Y axes. Excel enables you to add a trendline to a chart and also provides the equation you can use to plot additional points. The following steps explain how to accomplish this:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Set the value in cell C14 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Supply &amp; Demand</strong> worksheet to 14.</li>
            <li>Click anywhere in the chart area of the scatter chart to activate it.</li>
            <li>Click the Trendline button in the Layout tab of the Ribbon. Select the Linear Trendline option from the drop-down list.</li>
            <li>
                <p class="para">Select the Demand option from the Add Trendline dialog box and click the OK button. This adds a new line to the plot area of the chart as well as the legend.</p>
                <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_p03"><a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_f01">Figure 4.54 "Adding a Linear Trendline"</a> shows the scatter chart after adding a linear trendline. Notice that the line goes through only two points on the demand line. This indicates that this trendline may <em class="emphasis">not</em> be a good fit for the line that has been created on the chart.</p>

                <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_p04">Finding the right shape for a trendline may require trying a few different options. As shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_f01">Figure 4.54 "Adding a Linear Trendline"</a>, the linear trendline is not a good fit for the shape of the demand line. The remaining steps will demonstrate how to remove a trendline and access more trendline options:</p>
            </li>
            <li>Click the Trendline button in the Layout tab of the Ribbon. Select the None option from the drop-down list. This removes the trendline from the chart.</li>
            <li>Click the Trendline button in the Layout tab of the Ribbon again. This time, select More Trendline Options from the drop-down list.</li>
            <li>Select the Demand option from the Add Trendline dialog box and click OK. This opens the Format Trendline dialog box.</li>
            <li>Select the Power option from the Format Trendline dialog box.</li>
            <li>Click the “Display Equation on chart” option at the bottom of the Format Trendline dialog box (see <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s03_s03_f02">Figure 4.55 "The Format Trendline Dialog Box"</a>).</li>

Notice that the line fits perfectly over the demand series in the plot area. In fact, it may be difficult to see the line in the figure. This indicates that the trendline is an excellent fit for the demand line. As a result, we can be confident in using this line to predict other demand values along the X and Y axes. You can also see that the equation for this trendline has been added to the plot area of the chart. We can use the equation to calculate the price for each quantity value substituted for X. For example, if the number 150 is substituted for X in the equation, the result is a price of $2.59. Based on the values used to create the chart, this result appears to be accurate.</p>

                <li>When creating a scatter chart, it is best to start with a blank chart and add each data series individually. The highlight and click method is less reliable since numeric values are assigned to both the X and Y axes. As a result, Excel often guesses incorrectly which values are assigned to the X and Y axes.</li>
                <li>Finding the best fit for a trendline is often a matter of trial and error. You may have to try a few different trendlines to determine which form is the best fit for your data series.</li>
                <li>You must open the Format Trendline dialog box to add the line equation to the plot area of the chart.</li>

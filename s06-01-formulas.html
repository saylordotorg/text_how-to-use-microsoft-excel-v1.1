    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_p01">This section reviews the fundamental skills for entering formulas into an Excel worksheet. The objective used for this chapter is the construction of a personal cash budget. Most financial advisors recommend that all households construct and maintain a personal budget to achieve and maintain strong financial health. Organizing and maintaining a personal budget is a skill you can practice at any point in your life. Whether you are managing your expenses during college or maintaining the finances of a family of four, a personal budget can be a vital tool when making financial decisions. Excel can make managing your money a fun and rewarding exercise.</p>

Notice that this workbook contains four worksheets. The first worksheet, <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong>, contains formulas that utilize or reference the data in the other three worksheets. As a result, the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong> worksheet serves as an overview of the data that was entered and calculated in the other three worksheets of the workbook.</p>

Excel references the values entered into the cell locations used in formulas to produce outputs.

This means that Excel uses, or references, the number entered into the cell location when calculating a mathematical output.

We are calculating the spend per month for each category because people often get paid and are billed for these items on a monthly basis.

For example, <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s01_f03">Figure 2.4 "Formula Output for Monthly Spend"</a> shows the output of the formula that was entered into cell C3. However, this calculation needs to be performed for the rest of the cell locations in Column C. Since we used the D3 cell reference in the formula, Excel automatically adjusts that cell reference when the formula is copied and pasted into the rest of the cell locations in the column. This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relative referencing</a><span class="glossdef">Excel automatically adjusts a cell reference used in a formula or function relative to its original location when it is pasted into new cell locations.</span></span> and is demonstrated as follows:</p>

For each row, the formula takes the value in the Annual Spend column and divides it by 12. You will also see that cell D6 has been double clicked to show the formula. Notice that Excel automatically changed the original cell reference of D3 to D6. This is the result of relative referencing, which means Excel automatically adjusts a cell reference relative to its original location when it is pasted into new cell locations. In this example, the formula was pasted into eight cell locations below the original cell location. As a result, Excel increased the row number of the original cell reference by a value of one for each row it was pasted into.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s03_p02">The next formula to be added to the Personal Budget workbook is the percent change over last year. This formula determines the difference between the values in the LY (Last Year) Spend column and shows the difference in terms of a percentage. This requires that the order of mathematical operations be controlled to get an accurate result. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s03_t01">Table 2.3 "Standard Order of Mathematical Operations"</a> shows the standard order of operations for a typical formula. To change the order of operations shown in the table, we use parentheses to process certain mathematical calculations first. This formula is added to the worksheet as follows:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>Click cell F3 in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Detail</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>Type an equal sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">=</strong>).</li>
            <li>Type an open parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">(</strong>).</li>
            <li>Click cell D3. This will add a cell reference to cell D3 to the formula. When building formulas, you can click cell locations instead of typing them.</li>
            <li>Type a minus sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">âˆ’</strong>).</li>
            <li>Click cell E3 to add this cell reference to the formula.</li>
            <li>Type a closing parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong>).</li>
            <li>Type the slash (<strong class="emphasis bold">/</strong>) symbol for division.</li>
            <li>Click cell E3. This completes the formula that will calculate the percent change of last yearâ€™s actual spent dollars vs. this yearâ€™s budgeted spend dollars (see <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s03_f01">Figure 2.6 "Adding the Percent Change Formula"</a>).</li>
            <li>Press the ENTER key.</li>
            <li>Click cell F3 to activate it.</li>
            <li>Place the mouse pointer over the Auto Fill Handle.</li>
            <li>When the mouse pointer turns from a white block plus sign to a black plus sign, click and drag down to cell F11. This pastes the formula into the range F4:F11.</li>

The formula produces a result of a 299900% increase. Since there is no change between the LY spend and the budget Annual Spend, the result should be 0%. However, without the parentheses, Excel is following the standard order of operations. This means the value in cell E3 will be divided by E3 first (3,000/3,000), which is 1. Then, the value of 1 will be subtracted from the value in cell D3 (3,000âˆ’1), which is 2,999. Since cell F3 is formatted as a percentage, Excel expresses the output as an increase of 299900%.</p>

            <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s03_p05">It is important to note that the accuracy of the output produced by a formula depends on how it is constructed.

As shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s03_f02">Figure 2.7 "Removing the Parentheses from the Percent Change Formula"</a>, a poorly constructed formula can give you an inaccurate result. In other words, you can see that there is no change between the Annual Spend and LY Spend for Household Utilities. Therefore, the result of the formula should be 0%. However, since the parentheses were removed in this case, the formula is clearly producing an erroneous result.</p>

                <li>Mathematical computations are conducted through formulas and functions.</li>
                <li>An equal sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">=</strong>) precedes all formulas and functions.</li>
                <li>Formulas and functions must be created with cell references to conduct what-if scenarios where mathematical outputs are recalculated when one or more inputs are changed.</li>
                <li>Mathematical operators on a typical calculator are different from those used in Excel. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s01_t02">Table 2.2 "Excel Mathematical Operators"</a> lists Excel mathematical operators.</li>
                <li>When using numerical values in formulas and functions, only use universal constants that do not change, such as days in a week, months in a year, and so on.</li>
                <li>Relative referencing automatically adjusts the cell references in formulas and functions when they are pasted into new locations on a worksheet. This eliminates the need to retype formulas and functions when they are needed in multiple rows or columns on a worksheet.</li>
                <li>Parentheses must be used to control the order of operations when necessary for complex formulas.</li>
                <li>Formula auditing tools such as Trace Dependents, Trace Precedents, and Show Formulas should be used to check the integrity of formulas that have been entered into a worksheet.</li>

        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 1 Easy</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_p02">Running your own lawn care business can be an excellent way to make money over the summer while on break from college. It can also be a way to supplement your existing income for the purpose of saving money for retirement or for a college fund. However, managing the costs of the business will be critical in order for it to be a profitable venture. In this exercise you will create a simple financial plan for a lawn care business by using the skills covered in this chapter. Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 2 CiP Exercise 1.</p>

        <p class="simpara">Starter File: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gone.2012books.lardbucket.org/sites/all/files/ManzoExcel_1.0_Chapter_2_CiP_Exercise_2.xlsx">Chapter 2 CiP Exercise 2</a></p>
        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 2 Moderate</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_p03">The hotel management industry presents a wide variety of career opportunities. These range from running your own bed and breakfast to a management position at a large hotel corporation. No matter what hotel management career you choose to pursue, understanding the costs for any hotel operation is critical to running a successful operation. This exercise examines the relationship between cleaning expenses and the occupancy rate of a small hotel. Cleaning expenses are obviously influenced by the occupancy rate of the hotel. As more rooms need to be cleaned, the amount of overall cleaning expenses increases. However, to accurately estimate these expenses, you need to know whether there is a baseline, or fixed portion, of these expenses that does not change no matter how many rooms need to be cleaned. In other words, if you pay a cleaning staff a fixed salary, it does not matter if they clean 1 room or 100 rooms; their salary will remain the same. However, you may need more cleaning supplies as the number of rooms that need to be cleaned increases. In addition, the replacement of guest necessities such as soap, shampoo, lotions, and so on will also increase as the number of rooms to be cleaned increases. This exercise will demonstrate how these costs can be estimated through a technique called the <em class="emphasis">high-low method</em>. Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 2 CiP Exercise 2.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_l05">
            <li>Enter a formula in cell C5 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet to calculate the January capacity for the hotel. The capacity is calculated by multiplying the occupants per room (cell C3) by the number of rooms in the hotel (cell C2). This result is then multiplied by the number of days in the month (cell C5). Construct this formula so that relative referencing does not change cells C3 and C2 when the formula is pasted into other cell locations in Column C.</li>
            <li>Copy the formula in cell C5 and paste it into the range C6:C16. Use a paste method that does not remove the border at the bottom of cell C16.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula in cell E5 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet to calculate the occupancy capacity of the hotel. Your formula should divide the Hotel Capacity into the Actual Capacity. Format your result to a percentage with two decimal places. Then copy and paste the formula into the range E6:E16. Use a paste method that does not remove the border at the bottom of cell E16.</li>
            <li>Enter a function in cell C17 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet that sums the values in the range C5:C16. Copy the function and paste it into cells D17 and F17. Use a paste method that does not change the border on the right side of cell F17.</li>
            <li>Copy the formula in cell E16 and paste it into cell E17. Use a paste method that does not change the border at the bottom of cell E17.</li>
            <li>Sort the data in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet based on the values in the Actual Occupancy column in descending order (largest to smallest). For any duplicate values in the Actual Occupancy column, sort using the values in the Cleaning Expenses column in descending order.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, enter a function into cell B3 that shows the highest value in the range D5:D16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, enter a function into cell B4 that shows the lowest value in the range D5:D16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, enter a function into cell C3 that shows the highest value in the range F5:F16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, enter a function into cell C4 that shows the lowest value in the range F5:F16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, format cells B3 and B4 with a comma and zero decimal places. Format cells C3 and C4 with US dollars with zero decimal places.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, enter a formula in cell B5 that subtracts the lowest actual occupancy value from the highest actual occupancy value. Copy this formula and paste it into cell C5.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula in cell C6 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet that calculates that variable cost portion for the cleaning expenses per month. As mentioned in the introduction to this exercise, the cleaning expense contains costs that increase with each room that is cleaned. This is known as a <em class="emphasis">variable expense</em> and can be estimated by dividing the Actual Occupancy High Low Difference (cell B5) into the Cleaning Expenses High Low Difference (cell C5). Format the output of this formula to US dollars with two decimal places.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula in cell C7 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet that calculates the <em class="emphasis">fixed cost</em> portion for the cleaning expenses per month. This is the amount of money that will be spent on cleaning expenses no matter how many rooms are cleaned. Since we have calculated the variable cost portion of the cleaning expense, we can now use it to calculate the fixed expense. To do this, subtract from the High Cleaning Expense (cell C3) the result of multiplying the variable expense (cell C6) by the High Actual Occupancy (cell B3). Format the result of the formula to US dollars with zero decimal places.</li>
            <li>Enter the number 3500 in cell C2 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cleaning Cost Estimates</strong> worksheet. Format the number with commas and zero decimal places.</li>
            <li>Apply a yellow fill color to cell C2 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cleaning Cost Estimates</strong> worksheet. This is being formatted to indicate to the user of this worksheet that a number is to be entered into the cell.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cleaning Cost Estimates</strong> worksheet, enter a formula in cell C3 that calculates the estimated cleaning expenses given the number that was entered into cell C2. Now that we have calculated the variable and fixed expenses on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, we can use the results to estimate the cleaning expenses. The formula is <em class="emphasis">a</em> + <em class="emphasis">bX</em>, where <em class="emphasis">a</em> is the fixed cost, <em class="emphasis">b</em> is the variable cost, and <em class="emphasis">X</em> is the activity level that is typed into cell C2. The fixed cost is added to the result of multiplying the variable cost by the activity level in cell C2. Format the output of the formula to US dollars with zero decimal places.</li>
            <li>Save the workbook by adding your name in front of the current workbook name (i.e., “<em class="emphasis">your name</em> Chapter 2 CiP Exercise 2”).</li>
            <li>Close the workbook and Excel.</li>

The workbook that was given to you contains calculations for estimating the future value of investments and monthly mortgage calculations for purchasing a home. Your friend explained the following in an e-mail that was sent with the workbook:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_l08">
            <li>You will see in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Investment Plan</strong> worksheet that I have estimated the value of my investments in 5 years. My company is taking money out of my paycheck at the end of every month and investing it in the funds I have listed in Column A. I am pretty sure I did this right, but all my results in Column E are negative. I am not sure why this is happening.</li>
            <li>In the <strong class="emphasis bold">Mortgage Payments</strong> worksheet, I am trying to calculate the monthly payments for a house I am thinking about buying. However, the output of the function in cell B6 seems really high. There is no way I would be paying over $9,000 a month in mortgage payments. Something must be wrong.</li>
            <li>I don’t want to spend more than $775 a month for a mortgage. I thought I would be able to use Excel to determine what my target price for the house should be. My agent said that the current owners were probably willing to negotiate on the asking price for the house.</li>

            <li>Look at the PMT function in cell B6 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Mortgage Payments</strong> worksheet. Is the function set up to calculate monthly payments?</li>
            <li>You friend states that the target monthly mortgage payment is $775. What Excel tool could you use to change the price in cell B2 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Mortgage Payments</strong> worksheet so the mortgage payment is equal to $775?</li>

The price of the car you want is $18,000, but you do not want to spend more than $250 a month on car payments. If you lease the car, the terms of the lease will be 48 months at an annual interest rate of 5%. The residual value of the car will be set at $9,000. If you buy the car, your bank will offer you a 7-year loan at an annual interest rate of 6%.

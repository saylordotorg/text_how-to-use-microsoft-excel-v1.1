    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_p01">Perhaps the most valuable feature of Excel is its ability to produce mathematical outputs using the data in a workbook. This chapter reviews several mathematical outputs that you can produce in Excel through the construction of formulas and functions. The chapter begins with the construction of formulas for basic and complex mathematical computations. The second section reviews statistical functions, such as SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX, which can be applied to a range of cells. The last section of the chapter addresses functions used to calculate mortgage and lease payments as well as the valuation of investments. This chapter also shows how you can use data from multiple worksheets to construct formulas and functions. These skills will be demonstrated in the context of a personal cash budget, which is a vital tool for managing your money for long-term financial security. The personal budget objective will also provide you with several opportunities to demonstrate Excel’s what-if scenario capabilities, which highlight how formulas and functions automatically produce new outputs when one or more inputs are changed.</p>

The objective used for this chapter is the construction of a personal cash budget. Most financial advisors recommend that all households construct and maintain a personal budget to achieve and maintain strong financial health. Organizing and maintaining a personal budget is a skill you can practice at any point in your life. Whether you are managing your expenses during college or maintaining the finances of a family of four, a personal budget can be a vital tool when making financial decisions. Excel can make managing your money a fun and rewarding exercise.</p>

Notice that this workbook contains four worksheets. The first worksheet, <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong>, contains formulas that utilize or reference the data in the other three worksheets. As a result, the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong> worksheet serves as an overview of the data that was entered and calculated in the other three worksheets of the workbook.</p>

For example, <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s01_f03">Figure 2.4 "Formula Output for Monthly Spend"</a> shows the output of the formula that was entered into cell C3. However, this calculation needs to be performed for the rest of the cell locations in Column C. Since we used the D3 cell reference in the formula, Excel automatically adjusts that cell reference when the formula is copied and pasted into the rest of the cell locations in the column. This is called <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">relative referencing</a><span class="glossdef">Excel automatically adjusts a cell reference used in a formula or function relative to its original location when it is pasted into new cell locations.</span></span> and is demonstrated as follows:</p>

For each row, the formula takes the value in the Annual Spend column and divides it by 12. You will also see that cell D6 has been double clicked to show the formula. Notice that Excel automatically changed the original cell reference of D3 to D6. This is the result of relative referencing, which means Excel automatically adjusts a cell reference relative to its original location when it is pasted into new cell locations. In this example, the formula was pasted into eight cell locations below the original cell location. As a result, Excel increased the row number of the original cell reference by a value of one for each row it was pasted into.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s03_p02">The next formula to be added to the Personal Budget workbook is the percent change over last year. This formula determines the difference between the values in the LY (Last Year) Spend column and shows the difference in terms of a percentage. This requires that the order of mathematical operations be controlled to get an accurate result. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s03_t01">Table 2.3 "Standard Order of Mathematical Operations"</a> shows the standard order of operations for a typical formula. To change the order of operations shown in the table, we use parentheses to process certain mathematical calculations first. This formula is added to the worksheet as follows:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>Click cell F3 in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Detail</strong> worksheet.</li>

            <li>Type an open parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">(</strong>).</li>
            <li>Click cell D3. This will add a cell reference to cell D3 to the formula. When building formulas, you can click cell locations instead of typing them.</li>
            <li>Type a minus sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">−</strong>).</li>
            <li>Click cell E3 to add this cell reference to the formula.</li>

            <li>Type the slash (<strong class="emphasis bold">/</strong>) symbol for division.</li>
            <li>Click cell E3. This completes the formula that will calculate the percent change of last year’s actual spent dollars vs. this year’s budgeted spend dollars (see <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s03_f01">Figure 2.6 "Adding the Percent Change Formula"</a>).</li>

The formula produces a result of a 299900% increase. Since there is no change between the LY spend and the budget Annual Spend, the result should be 0%. However, without the parentheses, Excel is following the standard order of operations. This means the value in cell E3 will be divided by E3 first (3,000/3,000), which is 1. Then, the value of 1 will be subtracted from the value in cell D3 (3,000−1), which is 2,999. Since cell F3 is formatted as a percentage, Excel expresses the output as an increase of 299900%.</p>

                <li>Mathematical computations are conducted through formulas and functions.</li>
                <li>An equal sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">=</strong>) precedes all formulas and functions.</li>
                <li>Formulas and functions must be created with cell references to conduct what-if scenarios where mathematical outputs are recalculated when one or more inputs are changed.</li>
                <li>Mathematical operators on a typical calculator are different from those used in Excel. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s01_t02">Table 2.2 "Excel Mathematical Operators"</a> lists Excel mathematical operators.</li>
                <li>When using numerical values in formulas and functions, only use universal constants that do not change, such as days in a week, months in a year, and so on.</li>
                <li>Relative referencing automatically adjusts the cell references in formulas and functions when they are pasted into new locations on a worksheet. This eliminates the need to retype formulas and functions when they are needed in multiple rows or columns on a worksheet.</li>
                <li>Parentheses must be used to control the order of operations when necessary for complex formulas.</li>
                <li>Formula auditing tools such as Trace Dependents, Trace Precedents, and Show Formulas should be used to check the integrity of formulas that have been entered into a worksheet.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_p01">In addition to formulas, another way to conduct mathematical computations in Excel is through functions. Statistical functions apply a mathematical process to a group of cells in a worksheet. For example, the SUM function is used to add the values contained in a range of cells. A list of commonly used statistical functions is shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_t01">Table 2.4 "Commonly Used Statistical Functions"</a>. Functions are more efficient than formulas when you are applying a mathematical process to a group of cells. If you use a formula to add the values in a range of cells, you would have to add each cell location to the formula one at a time. This can be very time-consuming if you have to add the values in a few hundred cell locations. However, when you use a function, you can highlight all the cells that contain values you wish to sum in just one step. This section demonstrates a variety of statistical functions that we will add to the Personal Budget workbook. In addition to demonstrating functions, this section also reviews percent of total calculations and the use of absolute references.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s01_p02">The SUM function is used when you need to calculate totals for a range of cells or a group of selected cells on a worksheet. With regard to the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Detail</strong> worksheet, we will use the SUM function to calculate the totals in row 12. It is important to note that there are several methods for adding a function to a worksheet, which will be demonstrated throughout the remainder of this chapter. The following illustrates how a function can be added to a worksheet by typing it into a cell location:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>Click the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Detail</strong> worksheet tab to open the worksheet.</li>
            <li>Click cell C12.</li>
            <li>Type an equal sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">=</strong>).</li>
            <li>Type the function name <strong class="emphasis bold">SUM</strong>.</li>
            <li>Type an open parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">(</strong>).</li>
            <li>Click cell C3 and drag down to cell C11. This places the range C3:C11 into the function.</li>
            <li>Type a closing parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong>).</li>
            <li>Press the ENTER key. The function calculates the total for the Monthly Spend column, which is $1,496.</li>

However, this function is also needed to calculate the totals in the Annual Spend and LY Spend columns. The function can be copied and pasted into these cell locations because of relative referencing. Relative referencing serves the same purpose for functions as it does for formulas. The following demonstrates how the total row is completed:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s01_l02">
            <li>Click cell C12 in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Detail</strong> worksheet.</li>

            <li>Highlight cells D12 and E12.</li>
            <li>Click the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon. This pastes the SUM function into cells D12 and E12 and calculates the totals for these columns.</li>
            <li>Click cell F11.</li>
            <li>Click the Copy button in the Home tab of the Ribbon.</li>
            <li>Click cell F12, then click the Paste button in the Home tab of the Ribbon. Since we now have totals in row 12, we can paste the percent change formula into this row.</li>

The percent of total calculation shows the percentage for each value in the Annual Spend column with respect to the total in cell D12. However, after the formula is created, it will be necessary to turn off Excel’s relative referencing feature before copying and pasting the formula to the rest of the cell locations in the column. Turning off Excel’s relative referencing feature is accomplished through an absolute reference. The following steps explain how this is done:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s02_l01">

Normally, we would copy this formula and paste it into the range B4:B11. However, because of relative referencing, both cell references will increase by one row as the formula is pasted into the cells below B3. This is fine for the first cell reference in the formula (D3) but not for the second cell reference (D12). <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s02_f02">Figure 2.15 "#DIV/0 Error from Relative Referencing"</a> illustrates what happens if we paste the formula into the range B4:B12 in its current state. Notice that Excel produces the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">#DIV/0</a><span class="glossdef">Error code displayed in a cell containing a formula or function that is trying to divide by zero.</span></span> error code. This means that Excel is trying to divide a number by zero, which is impossible. Looking at the formula in cell B4, you see that the first cell reference was changed from D3 to D4. This is fine because we now want to divide the Annual Spend for Insurance by the total Annual Spend in cell D12. However, Excel has also changed the D12 cell reference to D13. Because cell location D13 is blank, the formula produces the #DIV/0 error code.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s06_p02">As shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s05_f02">Figure 2.25 "MAX Function Added to the Budget Detail Worksheet"</a>, the COUNT, AVERAGE, MIN, and MAX functions are summarizing the data in the Annual Spend column. You will also notice that there is space to copy and paste these functions under the LY Spend column. This allows us to compare what we spent last year and what we are planning to spend this year. Normally, we would simply copy and paste these functions into the range E13:E16. However, you may have noticed the double-line style border that was used around the perimeter of the range B13:E16. If we used the regular Paste command, the double line on the right side of the range E13:E16 would be replaced with a single line. Therefore, we are going to use one of the Paste Special commands to paste only the functions without any of the formatting treatments. This is accomplished through the following steps:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s06_l01">

One thing to note about these options is that you can preview them before you make a selection by dragging the mouse pointer over the options. As shown in the figure, when the mouse pointer is placed over the Formulas button, you can see how the functions will appear before making a selection. Notice that the double-line border does not change when this option is previewed. That is why this selection is made instead of the regular Paste option.</p>

The outputs allow you to analyze the details and identify trends as to how money is being budgeted and spent. Before we draw some conclusions from this worksheet, we will sort the data based on the Percent of Total column. As mentioned in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch01#manzoexcel_1.1-ch01">Chapter 1 "Fundamental Skills"</a>, sorting is a powerful tool that enables you to analyze key trends in any data set. We demonstrated the process of executing a single-level sort in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch01#manzoexcel_1.1-ch01">Chapter 1 "Fundamental Skills"</a>. For the purposes of the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Detail</strong> worksheet, we need to set multiple levels for the sort order. This is accomplished through the following steps:</p>

Notice that there are three identical values in the Percent of Total column. This is why a second sort level had to be created for this worksheet. The second sort level arranges the values of 8.4% based on the values in the LY Spend column in ascending order. Excel gives you the option to set as many sort levels as necessary for the data contained in a worksheet.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s07_p04">Now that the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Detail</strong> worksheet is sorted, a few key trends can be easily identified. The worksheet clearly shows that the top three categories as a percentage of total budgeted spending for the year are Taxes, Household Utilities, and Food. All three categories are necessities (or realities) of life and typically require a significant amount of income for most households. Looking at the Percent Change column, we can see how our planned spending is expected to change from last year. This is perhaps the most import column on the worksheet because it allows you to assess whether your plan is realistic. You will see that there are no changes planned for Taxes and Household Utilities. While Taxes can change from year to year, it is not too difficult to predict what they will be. In this case, we are assuming that there are no changes to the tax costs for our budget. We are also planning no change in Household Utilities. These costs can fluctuate from year to year as well. However, you can take measures to reduce costs, such as using less electricity, turning off heat when no one is in the house, keeping track of your wireless minutes so you do not go over the maximum allowed in your plan, and so on. As a result, there is no change in planned spending for Household Utilities because we will assume that any rate increases will be offset with a decrease in usage. The third item that is planned not to change is Insurance. Insurance policies for cars and homes can change, but as is true for taxes, the changes are predictable. Therefore, we are assuming no changes in our insurance policy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s07_p05">The first big change that is noticeable in the worksheet is the Food and Entertainment categories in rows 5 and 6 (see definitions in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s01_t01">Table 2.1 "Spend Category Definitions"</a>). The Percent Change column indicates that there is an 11.1% decrease in Entertainment spending and an 11.1% increase in Food spending. This is logical because if you plan to eat in restaurants less frequently, you will be eating at home more frequently. Although this makes sense in theory, it may be hard to do in practice. Dinners and parties with friends may be tough to turn down. However, the entire process of maintaining a budget is based on discipline, and it certainly takes a significant amount of discipline to plan targets for yourself and stick to them.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s07_p06">A few other points to note are the changes in the Gasoline and Vacation categories. If you commute to school or work, the price of gas can have a significant impact on your budget. It is important to be realistic if gas prices are increasing, and you should reflect these increases in your budget. To compensate for the increased spending for gas, the spending plan for vacations has been reduced by 25%. Budgeting often requires a certain degree of creativity. Although the Vacation budget has been reduced, there is still money you can set aside to make plans for spring break or winter break.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s07_p07">Finally, the budget shows a decrease in Miscellaneous spending of 19.8%. This was defined as a group containing several expenses, such as textbooks, school supplies, software updates, and so on (see <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s01_s01_t01">Table 2.1 "Spend Category Definitions"</a>). You may be able to reduce your spending in this category if you can use items such as online textbooks. This reduction in spending can free up funds for Clothes, a spend category that has increased by 20%. We will continue to develop the Personal Budget workbook further in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03">Section 2.3 "Functions for Personal Finance"</a>.</p>

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02_s07_l03">
                <li>Statistical functions are used when a mathematical process is required for a range of cells, such as summing the values in several cell locations. For these computations, functions are preferable to formulas because adding many cell locations one at a time to a formula can be very time-consuming.</li>
                <li>Statistical functions can be created using cell ranges or selected cell locations separated by commas. Make sure you use a cell range (two cell locations separated by a colon) when applying a statistical function to a contiguous range of cells.</li>
                <li>To prevent Excel from changing the cell references in a formula or function when they are pasted to a new cell location, you must use an absolute reference. You can do this by placing a dollar sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">$</strong>) in front of the column letter and row number of a cell reference.</li>
                <li>The #DIV/0 error appears if you create a formula that attempts to divide a constant or the value in a cell reference by zero.</li>
                <li>The Paste Formulas option is used when you need to paste formulas without any formatting treatments into cell locations that have already been formatted.</li>
                <li>You need to set multiple levels, or columns, in the Sort dialog box when sorting data that contains several duplicate values.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s01_p02">One of the functions we will add to the Personal Budget workbook is the PMT function. This function calculates the payments required for a loan or a lease. However, before demonstrating this function, it is important to cover a few fundamental concepts on loans and leases.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s01_p03">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">loan</a><span class="glossdef">A contractual agreement in which money is borrowed from a lender and paid back over a specific period of time.</span></span> is a contractual agreement in which money is borrowed from a lender and paid back over a specific period of time. The amount of money that is borrowed from the lender is called the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">principal</a><span class="glossdef">The amount of money borrowed from a lender.</span></span> of the loan. The borrower is usually required to pay the principal of the loan plus interest. When you borrow money to buy a house, the loan is referred to as a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mortgage</a><span class="glossdef">A loan used to purchase a home or property.</span></span>. This is because the house being purchased also serves as collateral to ensure payment. In other words, the bank can take possession of your house if you fail to make loan payments. As shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s01_t01">Table 2.5 "Key Terms for Loans and Leases"</a>, there are several key terms related to loans and leases.</p>

By law, a lender is required to provide an amortization table to a borrower.</span></span> for a loan. A lender is required by law to provide borrowers with an amortization table when a loan contract is offered. The table in the figure shows how the payments of a loan would work if you borrowed $100,000 from a lender and agreed to pay it back over 10 years at an interest rate of 5%. You will notice that each time you make a payment, you are paying the bank an interest fee plus some of the loan principal. Each year the amount of interest paid to the bank decreases and the amount of money used to pay off the principal increases. This is because the bank is charging you interest on the amount of principal that has not been paid. As you pay off the principal, the interest rate is applied to a lower number, which reduces your interest charges. Finally, the figure shows that the sum of the values in the Interest Payment column is $29,505. This is how much it costs you to borrow this money over 10 years. Indeed, borrowing money is not free. It is important to note that to simplify this example, the payments were calculated on an annual basis. However, most loan payments are made on a monthly basis.</p>

When you lease a car, the manufacturer or a leasing company retains ownership of the vehicle and you agree to make regular payments for a specific period of time. The amount of money you pay depends on the price of the car, the terms of the lease contract, and the car’s expected residual value at the end of the lease. The calculation of lease payments is similar to the calculation of loan payments. However, when you lease a car, you pay only the value of the car that is used. For example, suppose you are leasing a car that is priced at $25,000. The lease contract is for 4 years at an interest rate of 5%. The residual value of the car is $10,000. This means the car will lose $15,000 of its value over 4 years. Another way to state this is that the car will depreciate $15,000. A lease will be structured so that you pay this $15,000 in depreciation. However, the interest charges will be based on the purchase price of $25,000. We will look at a demonstration of leasing a car as well as buying a home in the next section.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s02_p02">If you own a home, your mortgage payments are a major component of your household budget. If you are planning to buy a home, having a clear understanding of your monthly payments is critical for maintaining strong financial health. In Excel, mortgage payments are conveniently calculated through the PMT (payment) function. This function is more complex than the statistical functions covered in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s02">Section 2.2 "Statistical Functions"</a>. With statistical functions, you are required to add only a range of cells or selected cells within the parentheses of the function. With the PMT function, you must accurately define a series of arguments in order for the function to produce a reliable output. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s02_t01">Table 2.6 "Arguments for the PMT Function"</a> lists the arguments for the PMT function. It is helpful to review the key loan and lease terms in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s01_t01">Table 2.5 "Key Terms for Loans and Leases"</a> before reviewing the PMT function arguments.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s03_p02">In addition to calculating the mortgage payments for a home, the PMT function will be used in the Personal Budget workbook to calculate the lease payments for a car. The details for the lease payments are found in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Car Lease Payments</strong> worksheet. Similar to the statistical functions, we can type the PMT function directly into a cell. However, you must know the definitions for each argument of the function and understand how these arguments need to be defined based on your objective. The terms for loans and leases are in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s01_t01">Table 2.5 "Key Terms for Loans and Leases"</a>, and the definitions for the arguments of the PMT function are in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s02_t01">Table 2.6 "Arguments for the PMT Function"</a>. The following steps explain how the PMT function is added to the Personal Budget workbook to calculate the lease payments for a car:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s03_l01">
            <li>Click cell B6 in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Car Lease Payments</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>Type an equal sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">=</strong>).</li>
            <li>Type the letters <strong class="emphasis bold">PMT</strong>.</li>
            <li>Type an open parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">(</strong>).Excel then provides a tip box showing the arguments of the function.</li>
            <li>Click cell B4. This is the interest rate being charged for the lease.</li>
            <li>Type the forward slash (<strong class="emphasis bold">/</strong>) for division.</li>
            <li>Type the number <strong class="emphasis bold">12</strong>. Since our goal is to calculate the monthly lease payments, we divide the interest rate by 12 to convert the annual rate to a monthly rate.</li>
            <li>Type a comma. When you type a function containing arguments, you must separate each argument with a comma. This signals to Excel that one argument has been defined and you are ready to define the next argument in the function.</li>
            <li>Click cell B5. This is the term or the length of time for the lease contract. Since the term is already expressed in months, we can just reference cell B5 and move to the next argument.</li>
            <li>Type a comma. This advances the function to the Pv argument.</li>
            <li>Type a minus sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">−</strong>). Remember that cell locations or values used to define the Pv argument must be preceded with a minus sign.</li>
            <li>Click cell B2 on the worksheet, which is the price of the car.</li>
            <li>Type a comma. This advances the function to the [Fv] argument.</li>
            <li>Click cell B3 on the worksheet. This is the residual value of the car. Note that cell location and values used to define the [Fv] argument are NOT preceded by a minus sign.</li>
            <li>Type a comma. This advances the function to the [Type] argument.</li>
            <li>Type the number <strong class="emphasis bold">1</strong>. We will assume that the lease payments will be due at the beginning of each month.</li>
            <li>Type a closing parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong>).</li>

Cell references can also be used to display values or the outputs of formulas and functions in cell locations on other worksheets. This is how data will be displayed on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong> worksheet in the Personal Budget workbook. Outputs from the formulas and functions that were entered into the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Detail</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">Mortgage Payments</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">Car Lease Payments</strong> worksheets will be displayed on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong> worksheet through the use of cell references.

The absolute reference shown for cell D2 prevents the cell from changing when the formula is copied from cell E6 and pasted into cell E7. The results of the formula show that our current budget allows for a savings rate of 5.9%. This is a fairly good savings rate.

We can project how much money can be saved over a specific period of time given set contributions and a rate of return. This calculation is accomplished through the future value, or FV, function. We will use the FV function in cell D10 of the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong> worksheet to calculate our savings plan projection. However, before we use the FV function, it is important to review a few basic concepts regarding the time value of money, as shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s05_t01">Table 2.7 "Key Terms for Time Value of Money Concepts"</a>.</p>

The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">time value of money</a><span class="glossdef">The opportunity to increase the value of money over time through investments that provide a constant or average positive rate of return.</span></span> is the opportunity to grow your money over time given a constant or average rate of return. For example, consider the data shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s05_f01">Figure 2.40 "Time Value of Money Example for a One-Time Investment"</a>. This data assumes that a person makes a one-time investment of $100 in a bond mutual fund that returns 5% interest per year. Notice that the interest paid in Column E increases every year. This is because the interest is reinvested in the mutual fund, which increases the total value of the investment. For example, the interest earned in year 1 is based on a $100 investment. Therefore, the interest paid is $5.00, or 5% of $100. However, in year 2, when the $5.00 interest payment is reinvested, the total investment increases to $105. Therefore, in year 2 the interest paid increases to $5.25, or 5% of $105. The value of the investment at the end of 5 years is $127.63. This is the value that can be calculated using the FV function.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s06_p02">Establishing a personal savings plan is one of the most important financial exercises you can do. For example, a savings plan is critical for establishing financial security for your retirement years. Many people mistakenly believe that saving for retirement is something you do when you get older. However, the greatest financial gains for your retirement can be achieved if you start saving in the earliest years of your career. Now that you have an understanding of the time value of money, you can see that the more years you can earn interest on your investments and reinvest those earnings, the more money you will have when you retire. Savings plans are also important for other key life events, such as going to college or buying a home. The FV function is a convenient tool that can help you establish savings goals and project the value of your investments over time. Similar to the PMT function, the FV function requires you to accurately define specific arguments in order to produce a reliable result. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s06_t01">Table 2.8 "Arguments for the FV Function"</a> provides definitions for each of the arguments in the FV function. It is helpful to review the time value of money terms in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s05_t01">Table 2.7 "Key Terms for Time Value of Money Concepts"</a> before using the FV function.</p>

            <li>Type a comma.</li>
            <li>Type a minus sign (<strong class="emphasis bold">−</strong>). All values or cell locations used to define the Pmt argument must be preceded by a minus sign.</li>

            <li>Click cell D14. Since the savings plan has a current balance, we use this to define the Pv argument of the function. This is equivalent to starting with a lump-sum investment.</li>
            <li>Type a closing parenthesis (<strong class="emphasis bold">)</strong>). There is no need to define the last argument of the function because we will assume that the savings in cash achieved in our budget will be invested at the end of each year of the savings plan.</li>

Notice that the current savings plan projection is $25,606. This is $606 higher than the target of $25,000 entered into cell D9, which shows that the current budget is working to achieve the goals of this savings plan. In other words, given the current net income, we are saving enough money to achieve our savings plan goals.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s06_p06">There are two important factors to notice with regard to this plan. The first factor is that our spending plan allows us to save enough money so that it can be invested to achieve our target of $25,000. The second factor is that the expected rate of return is 3.5%. This is a relatively low expected rate of return and could be achieved by investing in relatively low-risk investments such as bonds as opposed to stocks. This rate can be considered good because we can achieve our savings goals without having to make high-risk investments that could result in a significant loss of our savings.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s07_p02">We used several formulas and functions to complete the Personal Budget workbook shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s06_f01">Figure 2.42 "Results of the Savings Plan Projections"</a>. All the formulas and functions entered contain cell references that allow for a variety of what-if scenarios. Goal Seek is a tool that can be used in the process of conducting these what-if scenarios. Goal Seek maximizes the benefits of Excel’s cell-referencing capabilities by changing inputs to precise values to achieve specific outputs produced by formulas or functions. We will begin by changing one of the inputs in the Personal Budget workbook through the following steps:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s03_s07_p05">One of the most notable changes on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Budget Summary</strong> worksheet is the Savings Projection in cell D10. By spending an additional $500 a year on vacation plans, the projected savings value in 10 years decreases by $5,865. However, what if the rate of return were to increase? An increase in the rate of return could recover the decrease in the future value of our savings plan. We can use a tool such as Goal Seek to determine exactly how much the rate of return would have to increase to achieve our savings plan target of $25,000. The following steps explain how to use Goal Seek to accomplish this goal:</p>

Notice that in order to achieve the target savings plan of $25,000, the rate of return must increase to 7.8%. Initially, it appears that we can spend the additional $500 a year on vacations and still achieve our savings goal of $25,000. However, achieving a 7.8% annual rate of return will require us to make riskier investments with our savings. Thus, there is a greater possibility that we could lose a substantial amount of our savings. This is the downside of decreasing your overall savings rate. If you save less money, it forces you to take higher risks with the money you have in order to achieve higher rates of return. Unfortunately, many people end up on the losing end of these risks, which severely compromises their ability to reach their savings goals.</p>

                <li>When using the PMT or FV functions, the arguments must be defined in comparable terms. For example, when using the FV function, if the Pmt argument is defined using monthly payments, the Rate and Nper arguments must be defined in terms of months.</li>
                <li>The FV function is used to calculate the value an investment at a future point in time given a constant rate of return.</li>

        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 2 Moderate</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_p03">The hotel management industry presents a wide variety of career opportunities. These range from running your own bed and breakfast to a management position at a large hotel corporation. No matter what hotel management career you choose to pursue, understanding the costs for any hotel operation is critical to running a successful operation. This exercise examines the relationship between cleaning expenses and the occupancy rate of a small hotel. Cleaning expenses are obviously influenced by the occupancy rate of the hotel. As more rooms need to be cleaned, the amount of overall cleaning expenses increases. However, to accurately estimate these expenses, you need to know whether there is a baseline, or fixed portion, of these expenses that does not change no matter how many rooms need to be cleaned. In other words, if you pay a cleaning staff a fixed salary, it does not matter if they clean 1 room or 100 rooms; their salary will remain the same. However, you may need more cleaning supplies as the number of rooms that need to be cleaned increases. In addition, the replacement of guest necessities such as soap, shampoo, lotions, and so on will also increase as the number of rooms to be cleaned increases. This exercise will demonstrate how these costs can be estimated through a technique called the <em class="emphasis">high-low method</em>. Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 2 CiP Exercise 2.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_l05">
            <li>Enter a formula in cell C5 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet to calculate the January capacity for the hotel. The capacity is calculated by multiplying the occupants per room (cell C3) by the number of rooms in the hotel (cell C2). This result is then multiplied by the number of days in the month (cell C5). Construct this formula so that relative referencing does not change cells C3 and C2 when the formula is pasted into other cell locations in Column C.</li>
            <li>Copy the formula in cell C5 and paste it into the range C6:C16. Use a paste method that does not remove the border at the bottom of cell C16.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula in cell E5 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet to calculate the occupancy capacity of the hotel. Your formula should divide the Hotel Capacity into the Actual Capacity. Format your result to a percentage with two decimal places. Then copy and paste the formula into the range E6:E16. Use a paste method that does not remove the border at the bottom of cell E16.</li>
            <li>Enter a function in cell C17 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet that sums the values in the range C5:C16. Copy the function and paste it into cells D17 and F17. Use a paste method that does not change the border on the right side of cell F17.</li>
            <li>Copy the formula in cell E16 and paste it into cell E17. Use a paste method that does not change the border at the bottom of cell E17.</li>
            <li>Sort the data in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet based on the values in the Actual Occupancy column in descending order (largest to smallest). For any duplicate values in the Actual Occupancy column, sort using the values in the Cleaning Expenses column in descending order.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, enter a function into cell B3 that shows the highest value in the range D5:D16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, enter a function into cell B4 that shows the lowest value in the range D5:D16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, enter a function into cell C3 that shows the highest value in the range F5:F16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, enter a function into cell C4 that shows the lowest value in the range F5:F16 in the Actual Occupancy column on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Historical Costs</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, format cells B3 and B4 with a comma and zero decimal places. Format cells C3 and C4 with US dollars with zero decimal places.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, enter a formula in cell B5 that subtracts the lowest actual occupancy value from the highest actual occupancy value. Copy this formula and paste it into cell C5.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula in cell C6 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet that calculates that variable cost portion for the cleaning expenses per month. As mentioned in the introduction to this exercise, the cleaning expense contains costs that increase with each room that is cleaned. This is known as a <em class="emphasis">variable expense</em> and can be estimated by dividing the Actual Occupancy High Low Difference (cell B5) into the Cleaning Expenses High Low Difference (cell C5). Format the output of this formula to US dollars with two decimal places.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula in cell C7 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet that calculates the <em class="emphasis">fixed cost</em> portion for the cleaning expenses per month. This is the amount of money that will be spent on cleaning expenses no matter how many rooms are cleaned. Since we have calculated the variable cost portion of the cleaning expense, we can now use it to calculate the fixed expense. To do this, subtract from the High Cleaning Expense (cell C3) the result of multiplying the variable expense (cell C6) by the High Actual Occupancy (cell B3). Format the result of the formula to US dollars with zero decimal places.</li>
            <li>Enter the number 3500 in cell C2 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cleaning Cost Estimates</strong> worksheet. Format the number with commas and zero decimal places.</li>
            <li>Apply a yellow fill color to cell C2 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cleaning Cost Estimates</strong> worksheet. This is being formatted to indicate to the user of this worksheet that a number is to be entered into the cell.</li>
            <li>On the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cleaning Cost Estimates</strong> worksheet, enter a formula in cell C3 that calculates the estimated cleaning expenses given the number that was entered into cell C2. Now that we have calculated the variable and fixed expenses on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Cost Analysis</strong> worksheet, we can use the results to estimate the cleaning expenses. The formula is <em class="emphasis">a</em> + <em class="emphasis">bX</em>, where <em class="emphasis">a</em> is the fixed cost, <em class="emphasis">b</em> is the variable cost, and <em class="emphasis">X</em> is the activity level that is typed into cell C2. The fixed cost is added to the result of multiplying the variable cost by the activity level in cell C2. Format the output of the formula to US dollars with zero decimal places.</li>
            <li>Save the workbook by adding your name in front of the current workbook name (i.e., “<em class="emphasis">your name</em> Chapter 2 CiP Exercise 2”).</li>
            <li>Close the workbook and Excel.</li>

        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_p10">Your friend is working on a few financial calculations in Excel and is asking for your assistance. The workbook that was given to you contains calculations for estimating the future value of investments and monthly mortgage calculations for purchasing a home. Your friend explained the following in an e-mail that was sent with the workbook:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_l08">
            <li>You will see in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Investment Plan</strong> worksheet that I have estimated the value of my investments in 5 years. My company is taking money out of my paycheck at the end of every month and investing it in the funds I have listed in Column A. I am pretty sure I did this right, but all my results in Column E are negative. I am not sure why this is happening.</li>
            <li>In the <strong class="emphasis bold">Mortgage Payments</strong> worksheet, I am trying to calculate the monthly payments for a house I am thinking about buying. However, the output of the function in cell B6 seems really high. There is no way I would be paying over $9,000 a month in mortgage payments. Something must be wrong.</li>
            <li>I don’t want to spend more than $775 a month for a mortgage. I thought I would be able to use Excel to determine what my target price for the house should be. My agent said that the current owners were probably willing to negotiate on the asking price for the house.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol class="orderedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_l09">
            <li>Look at the FV function that was entered into cell E3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Investment Plan</strong> worksheet. Why is the output for this function negative?</li>
            <li>Assume that the output of the FV function in cell E3 was a positive $17,385 instead of negative. Does it make sense that given a 4.5% annual rate of return, starting balance of $10,000, and an ongoing investment of $900 per month that the value of the investment would be $17,385 after 5 years?</li>
            <li>Look at the PMT function in cell B6 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Mortgage Payments</strong> worksheet. Is the function set up to calculate monthly payments?</li>
            <li>You friend states that the target monthly mortgage payment is $775. What Excel tool could you use to change the price in cell B2 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Mortgage Payments</strong> worksheet so the mortgage payment is equal to $775?</li>
            <li>Based on your friend’s comments, make any necessary corrections to all the functions in the Investment Plan and <strong class="emphasis bold">Mortgage Payments</strong> worksheets. Set the price of the home in cell B2 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Mortgage Payments</strong> worksheet so the monthly payment equals $775.</li>
            <li>Save the workbook by adding your name in front of the current workbook name.</li>

        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_p12">You are in the process of getting a new car but are not sure if you should buy or lease. The price of the car you want is $18,000, but you do not want to spend more than $250 a month on car payments. If you lease the car, the terms of the lease will be 48 months at an annual interest rate of 5%. The residual value of the car will be set at $9,000. If you buy the car, your bank will offer you a 7-year loan at an annual interest rate of 6%. You are not required to make a down payment with either the lease or loan options, and payments are made at the end of the month for both options.</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch02_s04_p13">Should you lease or buy the car given your budget limit of $250 a month? Create a new workbook and design a worksheet that shows the difference between leasing and buying the car in terms of monthly payments. Use proper formatting so your worksheet is easy to read.

            <li>Your mortgage payments will be made at the end of each month.</li>
            <li>You must construct the amortization table so that any change in the loan variables, down payment percent, length of loan, interest rate, and so on will automatically produce new outputs for each month of the amortization table.</li>
            <li>The amortization table must show the interest payment, principal payment, and balance remaining to be paid on the loan for every month of the loan duration. The beginning balance for the last month of the loan should be equal to the principal payment in the last month.

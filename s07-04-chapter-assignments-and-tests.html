        <p class="simpara">Starter File: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gone.2012books.lardbucket.org/sites/all/files/ManzoExcel_1.0_Chapter_3_CiP_Exercise_1.xlsx">Chapter 3 CiP Exercise 1</a></p>
        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 1 Easy</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_p02">The challenge of pursuing any position in a retail career is analyzing large volumes of data to measure the financial performance of the business. Large retail corporations may service thousands of customers in hundreds of stores every day. This creates an enormous amount of sales data that is typically stored in large database systems. A retail analyst is typically asked to make sense of all this data and develop reports for other managers in the company. In fact, a retail analyst is often asked to prepare sales reports for the most senior executives in a retail corporation. The skills covered in this chapter are extremely valuable in helping a retail analyst summarize large volumes of data that allow other managers to understand the financial performance of the company and make critical decisions every day. In this exercise, you will create a sales report similar to one that is commonly used in a retail career. This part of the exercise utilizes the IF function to analyze the sales and inventory data by store. The information created from this analysis can be shared with a manager in the shipping department. Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 3 CiP Exercise 1.</p>

        <p class="simpara">Difficulty: Level 2 Moderate</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_p04">Medical groups are common in the health care industry and range in size. The defining trait of a medical group is that there is more than one doctor on staff for a particular practice, which creates more flexible hours for patients and physicians. In addition, a medical group can provide a variety of medical services in one location. This exercise illustrates how to use the skills presented in this chapter to summarize payroll details for employees working in a medical group. Begin this exercise by opening the file named Chapter 3 CiP Exercise 2.</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_l15">
            <li>Set the Freeze Panes command on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet so that Rows 1 and 2 and Columns A and B are locked in place while scrolling through the worksheet.</li>
            <li>Enter an IF function in cell G3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet to calculate the Social Security tax. Social Security funds are used by the government to provide income for people who are retired, a beneficiary of a retiree, or disabled. An employer must withhold 4.2% of an employee’s weekly pay for Social Security. However, an employee is only taxed up to $100,000. The logical test of the IF function should assess if the value in the Pay Year to Date column is greater than or equal to 100000. If the logical test is true, the output of the function should be zero. Otherwise, the function should multiply the value in the Gross Pay This Week by 4.2%. Copy and paste the function into the range G4:G22.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula in cell H3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet that calculates the Medicare Tax. Medicare funds are used by the government to provide medical financial support to senior citizens. Your formula should multiply the Gross Pay This Week by 1.45%. Copy and paste this formula into the range H4:H22.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula in cell I3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet that calculates the total FICA tax (FICA stands for Federal Insurance Contributions Act). Your formula should add the Social Security Tax to the Medicare Tax. Copy and paste this formula into the range I4:I22.</li>
            <li>Enter an IF function in cell J3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet to calculate the Federal Tax. If the Gross Pay This Week is less than or equal to 1150, then the tax is calculated by multiplying the Gross Pay This Week by 20%. Otherwise, this tax is calculated by multiplying the Gross Pay This Week by 25%. Copy and paste the IF function into the range J4:J22.</li>
            <li>If an employee has been working with the medical group for 1 or more years, the company will match 50% of the employee’s 401(k) retirement contributions. Calculate the company’s 401(k) retirement contributions by entering an IF function in cell L3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet. If the Years of Service is greater than or equal to 1, multiply the 401K Retirement value by 50%. Otherwise, the output of the function should be zero. Copy and paste the IF function into the range L4:L22.</li>
            <li>The medical group offers its employees an additional retirement benefit based on the employee’s position and years of service. Employees who are with the practice 3 or more years will receive an additional contribution to their retirement account. Calculate this benefit by entering an IF function in cell M3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet. If an employee is a physician <em class="emphasis">and</em> has been working in the medical group for 3 or more years, the function should multiply the Gross Pay This Week by 8%. For all other employees who have been working at the medical group for 3 or more years, the function should multiply the Gross Pay This Week by 5%. Copy and paste the function into the range M4:M22.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula into cell N3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet that calculates the Total Retirement Benefits. Your formula should add the 401K Company Match value to the Retirement Benefit value. Copy and paste the formula into the range N4:N22.</li>
            <li>Enter a formula into cell O3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet that calculates the Net Payment for each employee. Your formula should subtract the values in the range I3:K3 from the Gross Pay This Week in cell F3. The range I3:K3 includes the following: Total FICA (cell I3), Federal Tax (cell J3), and 401K Retirement (cell K3). Copy and paste this formula into the range O4:O22.</li>
            <li>Enter a COUNTIF function into cell B3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. The function should count the number of employees in the range A3:A22 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet for each Practice listed in Column A on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. Copy and paste the function into the range B4:B7.</li>
            <li>Enter an AVERAGEIF function into cell C3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. The function should calculate the average Years of Service in the range D3:D22 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet for each Practice listed in Column A on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. Copy and paste the function into the range C4:C7.</li>
            <li>Enter a SUMIF function into cell D3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. The function should sum the Total FICA tax in the range I3:I22 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet for each Practice listed in Column A on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. However, the government requires that employers match the FICA tax that is withheld from employees’ paychecks. Therefore, multiply the result of this SUMIF function by 2. Copy and paste the function into the range D4:D7.</li>
            <li>Enter a SUMIF function into cell E3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. The function should sum the Federal Tax withholdings in the range J3:J22 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet for each Practice listed in Column A on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. Copy and paste the function into the range E4:E7.</li>
            <li>Enter a SUMIF function into cell F3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. The function should sum the Net Payments in the range O3:O22 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet for each Practice listed in Column A on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. Copy and paste the function into the range F4:F7.</li>
            <li>Enter a SUMIF function into cell G3 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. The function should sum the Total Retirement Benefits in the range N3:N22 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet for each Practice listed in Column A on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet. Copy and paste the function into the range G4:G7.</li>
            <li>Enter a SUM function in cell B8 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Summary</strong> worksheet that sums the values in the range B3:B7. Copy and paste this SUM function into the range D8:G8. Then format the range D8:G8 to the Accounting number format.</li>
            <li>Save the workbook by adding your name in front of the current workbook name (i.e., “<em class="emphasis">your name</em> Chapter 3 CiP Exercise 2”).</li>
            <li>Close the workbook and Excel.</li>

        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_p06"><em class="emphasis bolditalic">Scenario</em></p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_p07">You recently became the inventory director for a medium-size apparel retail company. The company relies on you to keep a very close watch on the inventory levels for all the items the company sells. Any apparel inventory that is left unsold after the current season will have to be sold at a significant discount. Large excess amounts of inventory can result in drastic profit losses for the company. The company analyzes inventory based on a sell-through rate, which is the weekly unit sales divided by the current inventory units. A sell-through percentage between 12% and 15% is considered normal. At this rate the company will sell all inventory for an item in 6 to 8 weeks. However, a sell-through rate that is outside of this range will require immediate action. An analyst has e-mailed you an inventory status report based on the company’s inventory management guidelines. He explains the following in his e-mail:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_l16">
            <li>The Status column of the inventory contains a function I put together that tells us where we have issues. The company suggests that we put a “rush priority” on any inventory orders for more than 100 units in a week and for which the sell-through rate is greater than or equal to 20%.</li>
            <li>If the sell-through rate for any item is less than 10%, we have to work with the buyers to see if any incoming orders can be cancelled. The function I created indicates any slow-selling items with a “cancel warning” description.</li>
            <li>Overall, it looks like our biggest problem is that we don’t have enough inventory. In fact, most of the items on the report are showing a “rush priority.” I guess this is a good problem to have.</li>

            <li>Look at the Status column (Column E) for the first few items on the inventory report.

Document your observation in the <strong class="emphasis bold">AnswerSheet</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>Evaluate the construction of the IF function in the Status column for the first item. Does the function accurately evaluate the Sell Through percentages in Column D? Document your observation in the <strong class="emphasis bold">AnswerSheet</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>The company suggests that a rush priority be placed on any orders if the unit sales for an item are greater than 100 and the sell-through rate is greater than or equal to 20%. Does the IF function in the Status column accurately account for this condition? Document your observation in the <strong class="emphasis bold">AnswerSheet</strong> worksheet.</li>
            <li>Enter a new IF function in the Status column to accurately assess the inventory for each item based on the company’s inventory policies. Make any other adjustments to the worksheet so that it is easy to see all items that require “Rush Priorities” as well “Cancel Warnings.”</li>

        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_p10">The purpose of this assignment is to revisit the federal payroll tax calculations that were demonstrated in the Careers in Practice: Payroll for a Medical Group exercise. In that exercise, we assumed that if the employee’s weekly income was less than or equal to $1,150, the federal tax was estimated at 20%. For any income over $1,150, the federal tax was estimated at 25%. However, the IRS publishes tables that provide more details as to how federal taxes should be calculated and withheld for weekly payrolls.</p>
        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_p11">The Excel workbook for this assignment contains two worksheets. The <strong class="emphasis bold">Payroll Details</strong> worksheet is a subset of the data that was used for the Careers in Practice exercise. The <strong class="emphasis bold">Withholding Table</strong> worksheet contains part of an Excel worksheet that was published by the IRS. There are six levels of weekly income in Columns A and B of the worksheet. Columns C and D provide information for calculating the amount of federal tax that should be withheld. For example, if an employee’s weekly salary is $200, you would use Row 3 to calculate the amount of federal tax that should be withheld. This means you would first subtract the value in cell C3 from the weekly salary, which is: 200 − 111.15 = 88.85. Then the result of 88.85 is multiplied by the percentage in cell D3, which is: 88.85 × .10 = 8.885. Therefore, the federal tax that should be withheld for an employee who is paid $200 a week is $8.885. Expressed as a formula, the calculation would be as follows: (200 − 111.15) × .10.</p>

        <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_p14">The Excel skills demonstrated in this chapter can be used to create a dynamic and “smart” grade book for any academic course. Your assignment is to complete the grade book using several of the Excel skills that you have learned so far. Open the Excel workbook for this assignment and complete the grade book based on the following requirements:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_l19">
            <li>It is very important to make sure a student’s grade is accurately calculated. One area that must be checked often when calculating final grades is the percentages assigned to each requirement in the course. One way to do this is to see if the percentages add up to 100%. Use an IF function in the merged cells H2 and I2 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Grade Details</strong> worksheet to determine if the percentages in the range B2:G2 add up to 100%. If the percentages do not add up to 100%, show the phrase “Percentages do not equal 100%.” Otherwise, leave the cell blank (use two quotation marks: “”). Use the results of your IF function to make any necessary adjustments to the grade book (refer to <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_t01">Table 3.12 "Final Grade Calculation"</a> as needed).</li>
            <li>Calculate class averages in Row 29 for each course requirement as well as the final grades in Columns B through H.</li>
            <li>Use a VLOOKUP function to display the appropriate letter grade for each student in Column I. The <strong class="emphasis bold">Grade Table</strong> worksheet contains data that show how the letter grades should be assigned for the numeric grades.</li>
            <li>Complete the Class Grade Distribution in the range I32:I43 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Grade Details</strong> worksheet. The purpose of this area is to show how many students received the grades listed in the range H32:H43. For example, how many students receive an A, A−, and so on. Include a percent of total for each grade. <em class="emphasis">Hint: This can be accomplished using the COUNTIF function if you successfully complete the VLOOKUP function in step 3. If you are unable to complete step 3, you can still complete this step using the COUNTIFS function.</em>
</li>
            <li>Add any formatting enhancements to the <strong class="emphasis bold">Grade Details</strong> worksheet that would make the worksheet easier to read and use. Consider the “Special Note” in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch03_s04_t01">Table 3.12 "Final Grade Calculation"</a>.</li>

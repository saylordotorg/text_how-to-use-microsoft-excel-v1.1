    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_p01">This section reviews the most commonly used Excel chart types. To demonstrate the variety of chart types available in Excel, it is necessary to use a variety of data sets. Therefore, instead of addressing a specific theme, we will use a variety of themes. This is necessary not only to demonstrate the construction of charts but also to explain how to choose the right type of chart given your data and the idea you intend to communicate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_p02">Before we begin, let’s review a few key points you need to consider before creating any chart in Excel. The first is identifying your idea or message. It is important to keep in mind that the primary purpose of a chart is to present quantitative information to an audience. Therefore, you must first decide what message or idea you wish to present. This is critical in helping you select specific data from a worksheet that will be used in a chart. Throughout this chapter, we will reinforce the intended message first before creating each chart.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_p03">The second key point is selecting the right chart type. The chart type you select will depend on the data you have and the message you intend to communicate.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_p04">The third key point is identifying the values that should appear on the X and Y axes. One of the ways to identify which values belong on the X and Y axes is to sketch the chart on paper first. If you can visualize what your chart is supposed to look like, you will have an easier time using Excel to construct an effective chart that accurately communicates your message. <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_t01">Table 4.1 "Key Steps before Constructing an Excel Chart"</a> provides a brief summary of these points.</p>

This is an aggregate price index of five hundred of the largest publicly traded companies.

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s01_p03">Before we create the line chart, it is important to identify why it is an appropriate chart type given the message we wish to communicate and the data we have. When presenting the trend for any data over a designated period of time, the most commonly used chart types are the line chart and the column chart. With the column chart, you are limited to a certain number of bars or data points. As you increase the number of bars on a column chart, it becomes increasingly difficult to read. As you scroll through the data on the worksheet shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s01_f01">Figure 4.1 "52 Week Data for the S&amp;P 500 and Microsoft"</a>, you will see that there are fifty-two points of data used to construct the chart. This is generally too many data points to put on a column chart, which is why we are using a line chart. Our line chart will show the closing price for the S&amp;P 500 on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Y axis</a><span class="glossdef">The vertical axis of a chart.</span></span> and the week number on the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">X axis</a><span class="glossdef">The horizontal axis of a chart.</span></span>. The following steps explain how to construct this chart:</p>

            <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s01_p04">We can use both a line chart and a column chart to illustrate a trend over time. However, a line chart is far more effective when there are many periods of time being measured. For example, if we are measuring fifty-two weeks, a column chart would require fifty-two bars. A general rule of thumb is to use a column chart when twenty bars or less are required. A column chart becomes difficult to read as the number of bars exceeds twenty.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s02_p02">After creating an Excel chart, you may find it necessary to adjust the scale of the Y axis. Excel automatically sets the maximum value for the Y axis based on the data used to create the chart. However, the minimum value is usually set to zero. Depending on the data you are using to create the chart, setting the minimum value to zero can substantially minimize the graphical presentation of a trend. For example, the trend shown in <a class="xref" href="#manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s01_f04">Figure 4.4 "Line Chart Moved and Resized"</a> appears to be increasing slightly. However, the S&amp;P 500 increased by over 20% during this period, which is substantial. The presentation of this trend can be improved if the minimum value started at eight hundred. While it is certainly possible for the S&amp;P 500 to fall below eight hundred, it is most likely remote. The following steps explain how to make this adjustment to the Y axis:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s02_l01">
            <li>Click anywhere on the Y axis on the <em class="emphasis">52 Week Trend for the S&amp;P 500</em> line chart (<strong class="emphasis bold">Stock Trend</strong> worksheet).</li>

            <li>Click the input box for the “Minimum” axis option and delete the zero. Then type the number <strong class="emphasis bold">800</strong>. As soon as you make this change, the Y axis on the chart adjusts.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s03_p02">We will now create a second line chart using the data in the <strong class="emphasis bold">Stock Trend</strong> worksheet. The purpose of this chart is to compare two trends: the change in value for the S&amp;P 500 and the Microsoft common stock. <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch03#manzoexcel_1.1-ch03">Chapter 3 "Logical and Lookup Functions"</a> presented a personal investment portfolio where the investments were compared to a benchmark. The S&amp;P 500 is a benchmark that is commonly used to judge the performance of individual stocks. The purpose and message of this chart is to show whether Microsoft is performing better or worse than the S&amp;P 500 index. This type of analysis can be used to determine whether a stock should be sold, purchased, or held.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s03_p03">Before creating the chart to compare the S&amp;P 500 and Microsoft, it is important to review the data in the range E4:F55 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Stock Trend</strong> worksheet. We cannot use the price data for Microsoft and the S&amp;P 500 because the values are not comparable. That is, the data for Microsoft is in a range of $22.00 to $28.00, but the data for the S&amp;P 500 is in a range of 1,022 to 1,363. If we used these values to create a chart, we would not be able to see any substantial change in the trend for either the S&amp;P 500 or Microsoft. Therefore, formulas were used to calculate the percent change in value for the S&amp;P 500 and Microsoft for each week. For example, looking at cells E5 and F5 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Stock Trend</strong> worksheet, you see that the S&amp;P 500 increased 2.4% in week 2, whereas Microsoft increased 3.1%. The percent change calculations now provide an appropriate method of comparison. This is a very important step to consider when comparing trends.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s03_p04">The construction of this second line chart will be similar to the first line chart. The X axis will be the 52 weeks in the range A4:A55. However, the Y axis will be the percentages in the range E4:F55. This creates a problem because Columns B, C, and D will not be used in this chart. Therefore, we cannot simply highlight one contiguous range of cells to create the chart. In this chapter we will demonstrate two options for charting data that is not in a contiguous range. The following steps demonstrate the first option:</p>

If the variance between the values in your data series is never less than a multiple of 2 (i.e., 500 × 2 = 1000 or 1000 ÷ 2 = 500), calculate the percent change for each point in time on your worksheet. The percent change must be calculated with respect to the <em class="emphasis">first data point</em> for each series.

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s04_p02">A column chart is commonly used to show trends over time so long as the data are limited to approximately twenty points or less. For example, in <a class="xref" href="manzoexcel_1.1-ch01#manzoexcel_1.1-ch01">Chapter 1 "Fundamental Skills"</a> we showed a sales trend over a twelve-month period. Another common use for column charts is frequency distributions. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">frequency distribution</a><span class="glossdef">The number of occurrences for an established set of categories.</span></span> shows the number of occurrences by established categories. For example, a common frequency distribution used in most academic institutions is a grade distribution. A grade distribution shows the number of students that achieve each level of a typical grading scale (A, A−, B+, B, etc.). The <strong class="emphasis bold">Grade Distribution</strong> worksheet contains final grades for a hypothetical academic class. To show the grade frequency distribution, the numbers of students appear on the Y axis and the grade categories appear on the X axis. The following steps explain how to create this chart:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s04_l01">
            <li>Highlight the range A3:B8 on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Grade Distribution</strong> worksheet. Column B shows the number of students that achieved a grade within the grade category shown in Column A.</li>
            <li>Click the Column button in the Charts group section on the Insert tab of the Ribbon. Select the first format from the drop-down list of options, which is the Clustered Column format.</li>
            <li>Click and drag the chart so the upper left corner is in the middle of cell H2.</li>
            <li>Resize the chart so the left side is locked to the left side of Column H, the right side is locked to the right side of Column P, the top is locked to the top of Row 2, and the bottom is locked to the bottom of Row 16.</li>
            <li>Click the legend one time and press the DELETE key on your keyboard. Since the chart presents only one data series, the legend is not necessary.</li>
            <li>Click the title of the chart twice so the cursor is placed in front of the word <em class="emphasis">Class</em>.</li>
            <li>Type the following in front of the word <em class="emphasis">Class</em>: <strong class="emphasis bold">Final Grades for the</strong>.</li>
            <li>Click any cell location on the <strong class="emphasis bold">Grade Distribution</strong> worksheet to deactivate the chart.</li>

            <p class="para" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s04_p04">When using charts to show frequency distributions, the difference between a column chart and a bar chart is really a matter of preference. Both are very effective in showing frequency distributions. However, if you are showing a trend over a period of time, a column chart is preferred over a bar chart. This is because a period of time is typically shown horizontally, with the oldest date on the far left and the newest date on the far right. Therefore, the descriptive categories for the chart would have to fall on the X axis, which is the configuration of a column chart. On a bar chart, the descriptive categories are displayed vertically along the Y axis.</p>

Charts can also be placed in a dedicated worksheet called a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">chart sheet</a><span class="glossdef">An Excel worksheet that is designated for a chart.</span></span>. It is called a chart sheet because it can contain only an Excel chart. Chart sheets are useful if you need to create several charts using the data in a single worksheet. If you embed several charts in one worksheet, it can be cumbersome to navigate and browse through the charts. It is easier to browse through charts when they are moved to a chart sheet because a separate sheet tab is added to the workbook for each chart.

        <p class="para editable block" id="manzoexcel_1.1-ch04_s01_s07_p02">The next chart we will demonstrate is a pie chart. A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pie chart</a><span class="glossdef">A chart used to show the percent of total for each component of a data set.</span></span> is used to show a percent of total for a data set at a specific point in time. The data we will use to demonstrate a pie chart is related to the overall spending activity in the health-care industry. The <strong class="emphasis bold">Health Care</strong> worksheet contains data that shows total spending in the United States for the years 1969 and 2009. In 1969, the total amount spent in the United States for health-related expenses was over $66 billion. The pie chart shows how this $66 billion was funded.

You can quickly see that Health Insurance and Out of Pocket made up the majority of health-care spending in 1969. Similar to the column chart, the key to creating an effective pie chart is the number of categories presented on the chart. Although there are no specific limits for the number of categories you can use on a pie chart, a good rule of thumb is ten or less. As the number of categories exceeds ten, it becomes more difficult to identify key categories that make up the majority of the total. In this example, it is easy to see that two categories compose 75% of the total.</p>

As mentioned, the goal of this chart is to show the percentages on the Y axis and the years 1969 and 2009 on the X axis. However, notice that Excel places the spend sources on the X axis. The remaining steps explain how to correct this problem and complete the chart:</p>

            <li>Click the Switch Row/Column button in the Design tab on the Chart Tools section of the Ribbon.

            <li>Click and drag the chart so the upper left corner is in the middle of cell E19.</li>
            <li>Resize the chart so the left side is locked to the left side of Column E, the right side is locked to the right side of Column N, the top is locked to the top of Row 19, and the bottom is locked to the bottom of Row 37.</li>

            <li>Click the Data Table button in the Labels group of commands and select the Show Data Table with Legend Keys option from the drop-down menu. This is another way of displaying a legend for a column chart along with the numerical values that make up each component.</li>

Notice that the Out of Pocket category, or the amount of cash people paid for health-care expenses, decreased significantly from 1969 to 2009. However, the Health Insurance category increased significantly from 1969 to 2009. Overall, the chart shows that the total out-of-pocket and health insurance expense increased significantly from 1969 to 2009. These two categories made up approximately 75% of total health-care spending in 1969. By 2009, these two categories increased to over 80% of total health-care spending.</p>

                <li>Identifying the message you wish to convey to an audience is a critical first step in creating an Excel chart.</li>
                <li>Both a column chart and a line chart can be used to present a trend over a period of time. However, a line chart is preferred over a column chart when presenting data over long periods of time.</li>
                <li>The number of bars on a column chart should be limited to approximately twenty bars or less.</li>
                <li>For column, line, and bar charts, the X axis can be used only for labels, not for numeric values.</li>
                <li>When creating a chart to compare trends, the values for each data series must be within a reasonable range. If there is a wide variance between the values in the two data series (two times or more), the percent change should be calculated with respect to the first data point for each series.</li>
                <li>When working with frequency distributions, the use of a column chart or a bar chart is a matter of preference. However, a column chart is preferred when working with a trend over a period of time.</li>
                <li>A pie chart is used to present the percent of total for a data set.</li>
                <li>A stacked column chart is used to show how a percent total changes over time.</li>
